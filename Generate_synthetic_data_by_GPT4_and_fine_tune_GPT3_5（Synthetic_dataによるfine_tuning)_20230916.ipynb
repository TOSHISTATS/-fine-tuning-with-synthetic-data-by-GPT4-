I am writing this letter to draw your attention to a few issues I have been facing with the mortgage service provided by your organization.\\n\\nHaving been a loyal customer of your bank for several years, I have always appreciated your commitment to customer satisfaction. However, my recent experiences have left me disappointed and confused. The terms associated with my mortgage loan are quite complex and lack clear explanations. While I understand that mortgage documents are typically filled with jargon, I expected a more customer-friendly approach from your team to help me understand these terms better. This lack of clarity has created a barrier to managing my loan effectively.\\n\\nAdditionally, I have noticed that the interest rates on my mortgage loan are significantly higher than the current market rates. This has made me question the fairness and transparency of your services. I have browsed other financial institutions' offerings and noticed that their rates are more competitive. This discrepancy has not only added financial strain but has also led me to question the integrity of your institution.\\n\\nI understand that interest rates may vary depending on various factors, but I was not expecting such a vast difference. I believe that customers should be treated fairly and should be made aware of any changes that directly impact them. I, unfortunately, feel blindsided by the high interest rates and the lack of communication from your side.\\n\\nIn light of these issues, I request your immediate attention in resolving my concerns. Please provide me with an easy-to-understand breakdown of my mortgage terms and lend clarity on why the interest rates applied to my loan are so high.\\n\\nI look forward to a resolution that upholds the values of transparency, fairness, and customer satisfaction. Your swift response and corrective measures will be highly appreciated.\\n\\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation.\\n\\nYours Truly,\\n\\n[Customer's Name]   \n",

I am writing to address my dissatisfaction with your Checking or Savings Account services.\\n\\nAs a long-standing patron of your bank, I have always been impressed by the quality of your financial products and services. Sadly, the events of recent months have created a sense of disillusionment and disappointment in me that I feel compelled to express.\\n\\nFirstly, I am alarmed at the number of unexpected charges that have been levied on my accounts lately. These charges, which were not explicitly outlined when I opened the account, have posed significant inconveniences as they impact my financial planning. This arbitrary application of fees is a cause of major concern for me, and I believe this to be a lapse in the commitment to transparency that your organization is known for.\\n\\nSecondly, I am saddened by the quality of customer service I've received in relation to these issues. I reached out to your customer service department on multiple occasions to seek clarity about these unfamiliar charges, only to be met with disappointing responses. The lack of promptness, empathy, and comprehensive assistance from your team has exacerbated my problems and created a sense of mistrust in my mind.\\n\\nFor these reasons, I would like to request your immediate intervention in this matter. I urge you to review the charges applied to my account and provide an in-depth explanation for each one. Additionally, I implore you to examine the handling of my case by your customer service department and take steps to ensure such shortcomings in service are not repeated.\\n\\nMy continued relationship with your bank hinges on the satisfactory resolution of these issues. I earnestly hope you will take the necessary actions to rectify these problems.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your swift and satisfactory response.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Customer's Name]   \n",

However, my experience has been marred by a series of inconsistencies and a lack of transparency that I find unacceptable.\\n\\nThe most pressing issue lies in the irregularity and inconsistency of my loan payments. Despite my diligent financial management, various discrepancies in my statements have led me to question the integrity of your process. These unexpected fluctuations have caused undue stress and confusion, making it challenging for me to maintain a predictable payment schedule.\\n\\nPerhaps more concerning is the opaque nature of your student loan system. As a customer, I feel entitled to transparency and clarity regarding my financial commitments. However, I find myself navigating through complex terminologies and inexplicable charges which are neither clear nor comprehensive. I firmly believe that a process as significant as student loan management should be transparent, with all aspects clearly explained to the concerned individual.\\n\\nGiven these circumstances, I implore you to respond swiftly and rectify the issues I face. I request an accurate breakdown of my payments, which includes a logical explanation for all unexpected charges. Additionally, I ask for a detailed clarification of my loan terms in a language that can be easily understood by someone without a financial background.\\n\\nI highly value a transparent relationship with my lender, and I am confident that you will take my concerns into consideration to ensure your commitment to customer satisfaction is fulfilled.\\n\\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to your response.\\n\\nKind regards,\\n\\n[Customer's Name]   \n",

The recurring transaction delays and unclear fees have caused me both financial and emotional distress.\\n\\nMy most urgent concern revolves around the delay in transactions. As a frequent user of your services, these delays disrupt not only my personal but also my professional deadlines. Financial transactions are time-sensitive, and such unexpected delays reflect poorly on your service's reliability and efficiency.\\n\\nIn addition, I am baffled by the unpredictable and confusing fees levied on my transactions.

I made my decision to proceed based on these given facts. Unfortunately, my subsequent financial statements revealed charges and fees that I was never briefed about nor agreed to.\\n\\nThese additional charges have proven to be a financial challenge and, I must express, quite a shock. The existence of these hidden costs has led me to seriously question the transparency and reliability of your bank's mortgage services.\\n\\nThe unexpected financial strain is further aggravated by the fact that no satisfactory explanation has been provided for these charges. I was led to believe that our agreement was clear and final. Therefore, getting billed additional sums without any forewarning or adequate clarification feels misleading and improper.\\n\\nI consider this situation a breach of trust and hope you understand the gravity of the issue at hand. I request your utmost attention to this matter. Please provide a thorough and exhaustive breakdown of my charges, including an explanation for the unexpected extra fees that have unexpectedly appeared in my statements.\\n\\nI am hopeful that this email will instigate a thorough review of my situation and lead to a fair and swift resolution. I believe it's important that all customers, including myself, receive clear information about charges and financial obligations, and I trust you will take immediate steps to remedy the current situation.\\n\\nLooking forward to your prompt response.\\n\\nYours Faithfully,\\n\\n[Customer's Name]   \n",

I am writing this email to raise a serious concern about your Student Loan service that I am presently availing.\\n\\nWhen I chose your institution for my education loan, I believed it would support my educational journey. However, my experience so far has been quite contrary to my initial expectations, leaving me disappointed and financially stressed.\\n\\nThe crux of my issue lies in the unexpected increases in the interest rate of my student loan. These sudden hikes, that too without any prior information, are not only startling but also severely disrupt my financial planning. I am under the impression that this practice is unfair and lacks transparency, which contradicts the values your institution is reputed to uphold.\\n\\nMoreover, the response from your customer support to resolve these issues has been disheartening. I have found it difficult to get through to a representative and when I do, the responses are vague and devoid of any concrete solutions. Instead of alleviating my concerns, these interactions have only enhanced my frustration.\\n\\nI strongly urge you to look into this matter and provide an explanation for the sudden and repeated increases in my loan's interest rate.

I am writing to you as a deeply dissatisfied customer of your bank, particularly the Checking or Savings account service. I have found myself repeatedly frustrated and disappointed with the service I have received, and I feel it is necessary to alert you to these issues.\\n\\nMy first grievance pertains to unexpected fees that have been levied on my account. I have been charged numerous times for services I do not recall ever agreeing to, and I find these fees both confusing and detrimental to my financial well-being. The lack of communication and consultation regarding these charges undermines your bank's supposed commitment to transparency and customer satisfaction.\\n\\nMy second issue lies with the customer service I have received when seeking resolution for these unexpected fees. My enquiries have either been met with slow responses, or worse, none at all. When I have received responses, they have lacked both empathy and efficiency. This is not the level of service I expect from a bank of your reputation.\\n\\nIn addition to these issues, I have observed a lack of preventive measures or solutions offered to avoid similar issues in the future. This indicates a lack of efficiency and customer care, traits that are essential in modern banking.\\n\\nI am writing to request that my concerns be addressed as soon as possible. I would like a full explanation of these unexpected fees, a refund for any charges that were not explicitly agreed upon, and an assurance that these issues will not reoccur. Also, I would like to see a significant improvement in the quality of customer service.\\n\\nA prompt and fair resolution to this matter would go a long way in restoring my faith in your services.

One of my initial attractions to your services was the affordable interest rates offered, which, regrettably, have seen a significant and unanticipated increase recently. This has put strain on my financial planning and has caused undue stress.\\n\\nIn addition, I am dismayed at the lack of communication about these rate changes. It was only after I noticed the change in my monthly repayments that I was informed about this rate increase. The sudden and unexpected change, coupled with the lack of communication, is disturbing and leads to a sense of distrust.\\n\\nCustomers put great faith in their mortgage providers, and any changes in the agreed-upon terms should be transparently communicated in a timely manner. This abrupt change has affected my monthly budget, and had I been informed in advance, I would have had the opportunity to make necessary adjustments to accommodate this change.\\n\\nTherefore, I kindly request an immediate, thorough investigation into this matter. I would appreciate a comprehensive explanation for the reason behind this rate hike and why this crucial information was not communicated to me beforehand.\\n\\nThe foundation of our professional relationship is trust and open communication, and I hope you will address my concerns and restore my faith in your services.\\n\\nThank you for your attention and I am hopeful for a prompt resolution.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\n[Customer Name]   \n",

However, my recent experiences have left me disappointed and confused. The terms associated with my mortgage loan are quite complex and lack clear explanations. While I understand that mortgage documents are typically filled with jargon, I expected a more customer-friendly approach from your team to help me understand these terms better. This lack of clarity has created a barrier to managing my loan effectively.\\n\\nAdditionally, I have noticed that the interest rates on my mortgage loan are significantly higher than the current market rates. This has made me question the fairness and transparency of your services. I have browsed other financial institutions' offerings and noticed that their rates are more competitive. This discrepancy has not only added financial strain but has also led me to question the integrity of your institution.\\n\\nI understand that interest rates may vary depending on various factors, but I was not expecting such a vast difference. I believe that customers should be treated fairly and should be made aware of any changes that directly impact them. I, unfortunately, feel blindsided by the high interest rates and the lack of communication from your side.\\n\\nIn light of these issues, I request your immediate attention in resolving my concerns. Please provide me with an easy-to-understand breakdown of my mortgage terms and lend clarity on why the interest rates applied to my loan are so high.\\n\\nI look forward to a resolution that upholds the values of transparency, fairness, and customer satisfaction.

Recently, I've been charged with numerous fees that were never disclosed to me at the time of the creation of my account. It is disconcerting to see unexpected deductions from my balance without any prior information. Not only has this led to significant financial inconvenience, but it has also made me question the transparency of your services.\\n\\nMoreover, I have called your customer service helpline several times to comprehend these charges. Instead of receiving prompt and adequate support, I was met with unresponsiveness and vague answers. The absence of efficient customer service has further exacerbated my concerns and left me feeling neglected by an institution I have trusted with my financial wellbeing.\\n\\nIn view of the above, I demand an immediate and thorough examination of these hidden charges on my account. I request a detailed breakdown of all the fees and charges applied to my account along with an explanation for each one. Further, I urge you to assess your customer service operations and take necessary rectifications to ensure customers are met with the support they require.\\n\\nThe trust and loyalty of your customers are built on the foundation of transparency and excellent customer service. I hope you understand the severity of the issues I have highlighted in this letter and take swift action to resolve them.\\n\\nI look forward to your prompt response and resolution of my concerns.\\n\\nBest Regards,\\n\\n[Customer's Name]</td>\n",

However, my experience has been quite different.

She goes to XXXX  in XXXX XXXX, and I live and work in XXXX XXXX. There was a Fraudulent ATM withdrawal in Florida on XX/XX/XXXX for {$1000.00}. The account only had around {$240.00} balance at the time of withdrawal. Wells Fargo ATM allowed the transaction because they said the account had overdraft protection. There had never been a legitimate {$1000.00} withdrawal from that account and neither I nor my daughter ever asked for overdraft protection and not sure how it was added. I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and reported it as fraud and filed a claim. They said they'll investigate it and on XX/XX/XXXX responded that they denied the claim and said I must have provided my account info to someone else to withdraw on my behalf. That is a lie. This was a fraudulent transaction that Wells Fargo allowed and they need to accept responsibility for it.   \n",

US Bank withdrew {$9900.00} from my XXXX XXXX checking account. However, US Bank has not given me credit for the principal payment. US Bank shows on my account activity a payment of {$9900.00} and then a payment reversal of {$9900.00}. When I spoke with customer service manager, I was assured that the {$9900.00} would be returned to my XXXX XXXX checking account. When after nearly a week I did not receive the {$9900.00}, I called back US Bank. I am now told by the customer service representative that the {$9900.00} seems to be lost in the process and was told an investigation has been requested. The investigation will take about XXXX business days. I want the {$9900.00} returned to me immediately and I do not want to be charged the interest on my XXXX  loan for this amount while my money is missing due to the fault of US Bank.   \n",

At the time of the creation of the account, I was able to register for Online access, but was unable to access the online platform. I have been continuously unable to login to access my account or funds. On XX/XX/XXXX, I tried messaging customer support on their Website, and received no response. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the company and asked for help, to which they told me a support ticket would be opened, and Id be contacted shortly. It never happened. Ive been unable to access my money for almost a month.   \n",

              "199390  Near the end of XXXX 2016 I opened a Citigold checking account with the promotion code : XXXX. The promotion offered XXXX AAdvantage miles after making {$1000.00} in debit card purchases and 1 or more qualifying bill payments for 2 consecutive calendar months. I completed the requirements on XXXX XXXX, 2016. A couple of weeks ago I realized that I still had not received my miles, so I called the Citigold customer service number. The service rep confirmed that the promotion was linked to my account and that I had met all of the requirements, but said that it could take up to 90 days ( after meeting requirements ) for the miles to post. That date would be XXXX/XXXX/16. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I still did not have the miles, so I called them again. The service rep could not figure out why I did not get the miles and escalated my case to be \" investigated ''. Today I received an email from them stating that I was not \" the individual to whom the offer was addressed ''. I called in again to ask about this and the customer service rep escalated my call to a supervisor ( XXXX, I think was his name ). I explained to him that I applied for the account online and even printed out the \" Promotion Disclosures '' which stated all the terms and conditions. He asked if it had my name on it, because then perhaps he could make an exception for me, but obviously it did not ; it was just a pop-up window. I explained that I did not have any screenshots or anything of the application with my name on it because that would be an insanely unsafe thing to do! He put me on hold and came back with the same response I got from everyone before : that I was not targeted for the offer. I told him that I was literally holding a printout of the Disclosures and in the Terms and Conditions, it states \" This offer is available to Citi/AAdvantage credit cardmembers who receive this communication. '' Well, at the time I had a Citi AAdvantage Gold XXXX, so everything seemed fine. XXXX told me that \" this communication '' was referring to a targeted offer. WHAT THE HECK??? If I am literally reading something and it says \" this communication '' without any other description, then the communication is what I am reading, right??? XXXX again told me No and that unfortunately the website ca n't tell who is or is n't the \" targeted customer. '' So that 's my fault??? The worst part is that I had made plans based on receiving these miles. I also was paying $ XXXX/month for the account over the last two months, all the while being told I would receive the miles by XXXX/XXXX/16. XXXX told me that the best he could do is close my account today and make sure I 'm not charged another {$30.00} in two days. Gee thanks. \\n\\nWhile I was on the phone with them, I did a web search and found that many people received their miles/points using the exact same application process I did, but that earlier this year Citi started rejecting the promo as they did in my case. I heard from several people that filed a complaint with the CFPB and were able to get their promo bonus. I told this to XXXX hoping he would keep me from having to compose this complaint, and he told me that Citi was granting the bonuses after complaints earlier, but now they 're fighting back harder because it 's costing them too much. Wait a sec -- so you 're telling me that not only did you start granting the miles/points because it was the right thing to do, but instead of honoring the promotion, you went the other way and are now fighting this even harder because it 's costing your company too much??? Insane!!! \\n\\nPLEASE help me.   \n",

Immediately thereafter, and pursuant to CHL 's instructions ; we submitted our signed documents which we Faxed ( verified ) & Mailed. We immediately began paying the agreed upon amount FAITHFULLY/MONTHLY to present day. \\nIn XXXX CHL sent a foreclosure notice and when I called they indicated that they had not received the aforementioned documents before a XXXX deadline and they were therefore going to foreclose on our loan. CHL said they called and sent notifications BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE!!! as we only received a letter in XXXX stating the correct address to send our Bank Checks to as being XXXX not XXXX as I was sending the Bank Checks to the XXXX address as instructed by a representative which I spoke with. That is THE ONLY correspondence we received from CHL - for had they merely indicated that they did not receive said documents we would have immediately remedied the situation. \\nThe Bottom Line is CHL accepted and cashed our checks for several months now which in any court of law is validation of the contract between us. \\n\\nIt should be noted that throughout the process of being completely ignored by the XXXX XXXX XXXX after being transferred from XXXX XXXX Bank - the entire process of dealing with CHL was excruciatingly difficult - and mind you - I 'm a XXXX with an XXXX!!! CHL seemingly/purposefully made Loan Modification Process exceedingly difficult. They would send out the same packets of documentations time after time and oftentimes requesting information that had already long since been sent and verified as being received by follow up phone calls. And please do note that it more often the case that the representatives gave completely different explanations when compared to the documentation they sent out. \\n\\nOftentimes it seemed like we were dealing with several different disjointed companies when trying to communicate with CHL. No one had answers to seemingly simple questions concerning their documentation inquiries. \\n\\nIn perusing the online complaints it was readily understood that we were in an uphill battle in dealing with CHL, but nothing prepared us for how incompetent this organization was. \\n\\nXXXX can only hope and trust that they, like XXXX and other evil establishments, will be levied well-deserved punitive fines and fees for how they have mistreated their clients. \\n\\nReiterating : We complied with every request made of us - we were granted a loan modification - faithfully made our payments from XXXX through to XXXX - and then unexpectedly received notification that we were being foreclosed on - without a single phone call/message or registered letter which one would think would be well warranted in a situation like this. CHL sent us NOTHING save for an address correction for payment! \\n\\nFor if we had XXXX iota of an indication that there was a discrepancy we would have moved heaven and earth to remedy the situation. \\n\\nWith all that being said, we want to thank you for your time and efforts on our behalf as we are truly at your mercy against an unmovable object. \\n\\nGratefully yours, XXXX   \n",

The car fax indicated car had no history of acci- dents. Being a senior citizen I was looking for reliable fairly new transport- tation. On XX/XX/XXXX the front XXXX bumpers were disconnected from the body of ccar car. I immediately phoned Drivetime and was told to call the Warranty com- pany from which I purchased an extended service. I was told to take the car to ] XXXX XXXX where I was told they did not do this kind of work. XXXX told me that same day to then take the car to XXXX on XXXX. XXXX informed me after inspection that XXXX did not cover. However he was kind enough to bond both sides as a courtesy. This lasted approx. two month. XXXX XXXX also informed me and visually pointed out to me that the car had indeed been in an accident at some point. Someone had previously painted over to cover up scratches and dings. On XX/XX/XXXX I and my sister were perform- at our nephews wedding. Dressed in formal attire, the bumpers not only came aloo a part again as well as the plastic near wheel wells to protect from water in - undercarriage. It was horrendous that XXXX are on the berm attempting to XXXX glue car parts enough to get the car to safety. Drivetime/ XXXX was called on that Monday, and they agreed to have XXXX glue it with a h {$100.00} deductible. It stayed done for another month or so. There have been numerous problems with the car, however it does not qualify for the lemon law as I as it is a fairly new auto. Not other time has Drivetime/XXXX who I believe is one company has approved a repair. I have been to XXXX XXXX for me- canicle problems, denied. Recently the car went out of control. I was advised to to take auto to XXXX and found it was {$690.00} invoice for Stuts. I was de- nide. The car is a piece of junk. These are just a few of the problems. I have been consistent with upkeep, oil change, new tires, alignment etc. But I was in- formed that I did n't do enough because of high milage. I am retired. I drive to another city to visit my sister often due to her suffering a lose of family memb ber. I have since contacted XXXX and was given a case number when I ex- plain the difficulties I am having with the bumper etc,. I informed them that I had recently rented a XXXX XXXX XXXX and the bumper was disconnected as is my nieces XXXX XXXX. They are at least appearing concerned. I spoke with Drivetime on XX/XX/XXXX re : the latest problem and was told that al- though XXXX denied claim they wanted me to send in the receipts from XXXX, letter explaining problems and they would possibly be able to assist with repair. I have never missed a payment. I mailed it in and never heard anything else. On XX/XX/XXXX I called and they said it was never received and if it went to the address on company letter head, it was probably tossed. I gave the information over the phone and was told they would contact XXXX and get back to me in 24 hrs. Well needless to say, I have heard nothing. \\nThey come off as a real friend to people with credit problems but it is a front to get your business and then they drop the ball. It took me calling the XXXX on XXXX to get them to cancel that terrible warranty after asking since XX/XX/XXXX and of course they never got the written request. I am too old to have to fight fight with this company and all they ever say is \" we 're reaching out to you '' Please help. I am stuck with an undriveable piece of junk that I pay {$410.00} a month for. Sincerely.   \n",

Left me his only son all his belongings, he was also single. \\nMy mother, his ex wife since XX/XX/XXXX, and he remained friends and she stayed with him in his house his last XXXX years of his life to help care for him. My mother, unknown to me at the time, was presenting herself to al of my father 's creditors as his \" wife ''. My father right before his death made it clear to me he was not agreeable to being presented to anyone as husband and wife regarding my mother for any reason. \\nUpon the time of my father 's death me and my family were living in a leased home. My mother qualified and received my fathers social security since they had been married XXXX years ( XXXX ). She stayed in the house and made the payment until I and my family were able to complete our lease on our home and move into my father 's home, as he and we wanted. I completed a probate since my father had no will and was single. \\nMy mother moved out of the home and I started taking over the payments. Then I was laid off work. When I initally contacted the mortgage company they informed me they were unable to speak to me because in their records they had that XXXX XXXX ( my mother ) was the righful owner of the house since my father passed. I had to explain she was not his wife. I sent them all the correlative documents. I asked for a deferrment of a payment, they said no because i was not the mortgage holder. Next they started transferring my account to different locations of their \" servicing centers '' and each time I would go through the whole explanation of who I was and have to send the documentation again. All the while sending the documentation to their corporate office and speaking with them. At XXXX point I set up auto withdrawal, they would do that. The XXXX XXXX did n't go through my account because their system wanted to withdraw at XXXX and my salary did n't deposit into my account until XXXX XXXX. At this point they would n't take a check from me. All the while I am requesting a modification of the loan. Each time my account was transferred to a new \" servicing center '' their employee would tell me to send a voided check and signature to authorize automatic withdrawal and I did each time. They never set it up. So in fear of the automatica withdraw suddently going into effect I refused to send more payments until someone would agree to something. They never would. \\nI just want to keep the house. Now that I have found the 12 CFR Part 1026 RIN 3170-ZA00 Application of REgulation Z 's Ability to Repay Rule to Certain Situations involving Successors in Interest, I believe the mortgage company violated this rule. I made it clear to the mortgage company I had every intention of keeping the home and paying the mortgage. Now they have filed foreclosure. This rule really hit home with me when I read it, because talking to several different people with Citifiancial I had some ask me why I did n't ask for a modification and then others tell me that a modification was n't possible! It appears it was all along. \\nLastly, my wife ( XXXX XXXX ) and I have Power of Attorneys on each other and she has permission to speak to anyone regarding anything pertaining to these matters. \\nI am attaching the foreclosure petition and our answer, death cert, probate, power of attorneys and correspondence i have had with the mortgage company.   \n",

The promotion offered XXXX AAdvantage miles after making {$1000.00} in debit card purchases and 1 or more qualifying bill payments for 2 consecutive calendar months. I completed the requirements on XXXX XXXX, 2016. A couple of weeks ago I realized that I still had not received my miles, so I called the Citigold customer service number. The service rep confirmed that the promotion was linked to my account and that I had met all of the requirements, but said that it could take up to 90 days ( after meeting requirements ) for the miles to post. That date would be XXXX/XXXX/16. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I still did not have the miles, so I called them again. The service rep could not figure out why I did not get the miles and escalated my case to be \" investigated ''. Today I received an email from them stating that I was not \" the individual to whom the offer was addressed ''. I called in again to ask about this and the customer service rep escalated my call to a supervisor ( XXXX, I think was his name ). I explained to him that I applied for the account online and even printed out the \" Promotion Disclosures '' which stated all the terms and conditions. He asked if it had my name on it, because then perhaps he could make an exception for me, but obviously it did not ; it was just a pop-up window. I explained that I did not have any screenshots or anything of the application with my name on it because that would be an insanely unsafe thing to do! He put me on hold and came back with the same response I got from everyone before : that I was not targeted for the offer. I told him that I was literally holding a printout of the Disclosures and in the Terms and Conditions, it states \" This offer is available to Citi/AAdvantage credit cardmembers who receive this communication. '' Well, at the time I had a Citi AAdvantage Gold XXXX, so everything seemed fine. XXXX told me that \" this communication '' was referring to a targeted offer. WHAT THE HECK??? If I am literally reading something and it says \" this communication '' without any other description, then the communication is what I am reading, right??? XXXX again told me No and that unfortunately the website ca n't tell who is or is n't the \" targeted customer. '' So that 's my fault??? The worst part is that I had made plans based on receiving these miles. I also was paying $ XXXX/month for the account over the last two months, all the while being told I would receive the miles by XXXX/XXXX/16. XXXX told me that the best he could do is close my account today and make sure I 'm not charged another {$30.00} in two days. Gee thanks. \\n\\nWhile I was on the phone with them, I did a web search and found that many people received their miles/points using the exact same application process I did, but that earlier this year Citi started rejecting the promo as they did in my case. I heard from several people that filed a complaint with the CFPB and were able to get their promo bonus. I told this to XXXX hoping he would keep me from having to compose this complaint, and he told me that Citi was granting the bonuses after complaints earlier, but now they 're fighting back harder because it 's costing them too much. Wait a sec -- so you 're telling me that not only did you start granting the miles/points because it was the right thing to do, but instead of honoring the promotion, you went the other way and are now fighting this even harder because it 's costing your company too much???

Left me his only son all his belongings, he was also single. \\nMy mother, his ex wife since XX/XX/XXXX, and he remained friends and she stayed with him in his house his last XXXX years of his life to help care for him. My mother, unknown to me at the time, was presenting herself to al of my father 's creditors as his \" wife ''. My father right before his death made it clear to me he was not agreeable to being presented to anyone as husband and wife regarding my mother for any reason. \\nUpon the time of my father 's death me and my family were living in a leased home. My mother qualified and received my fathers social security since they had been married XXXX years ( XXXX ). She stayed in the house and made the payment until I and my family were able to complete our lease on our home and move into my father 's home, as he and we wanted. I completed a probate since my father had no will and was single. \\nMy mother moved out of the home and I started taking over the payments. Then I was laid off work. When I initally contacted the mortgage company they informed me they were unable to speak to me because in their records they had that XXXX XXXX ( my mother ) was the righful owner of the house since my father passed. I had to explain she was not his wife. I sent them all the correlative documents. I asked for a deferrment of a payment, they said no because i was not the mortgage holder. Next they started transferring my account to different locations of their \" servicing centers '' and each time I would go through the whole explanation of who I was and have to send the documentation again. All the while sending the documentation to their corporate office and speaking with them. At XXXX point I set up auto withdrawal, they would do that. The XXXX XXXX did n't go through my account because their system wanted to withdraw at XXXX and my salary did n't deposit into my account until XXXX XXXX. At this point they would n't take a check from me. All the while I am requesting a modification of the loan. Each time my account was transferred to a new \" servicing center '' their employee would tell me to send a voided check and signature to authorize automatic withdrawal and I did each time. They never set it up. So in fear of the automatica withdraw suddently going into effect I refused to send more payments until someone would agree to something. They never would. \\nI just want to keep the house. Now that I have found the 12 CFR Part 1026 RIN 3170-ZA00 Application of REgulation Z 's Ability to Repay Rule to Certain Situations involving Successors in Interest, I believe the mortgage company violated this rule. I made it clear to the mortgage company I had every intention of keeping the home and paying the mortgage. Now they have filed foreclosure. This rule really hit home with me when I read it, because talking to several different people with Citifiancial I had some ask me why I did n't ask for a modification and then others tell me that a modification was n't possible! It appears it was all along. \\nLastly, my wife ( XXXX XXXX ) and I have Power of Attorneys on each other and she has permission to speak to anyone regarding anything pertaining to these matters. \\nI am attaching the foreclosure petition and our answer, death cert, probate, power of attorneys and correspondence i have had with the mortgage company.</td>\n",

Their search turned up XXXX line of credit loans with PNC bankXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX old line that I thought had expired years ago. The other XXXX XXXX ) was a current line that was an active account. I called PNC customer service and was told to FAX a letter to remove the loans from the books. I decided to do these XXXX XXXX XXXX ) at a time so to avoid confusion. After hearing nothing more about the loan for two weeks, the PNC customer service person said it would take about ten days, I called again. The PNC customer service person said they never got my FAX and to resend the letter again which I did. About a week later I went to a local PNC branch office to talk to some XXXX in person about the issues I was having. While there I spoke with another PNC customer service person and she told me that the loan office had never received my second FAX. I sent another request to remove this loan from there and went home. When I got home the mail was in and with it was a letter from PNC that they had removed ( XXXX ) from the books. I was confused but happy, XXXX down XXXX more to go XXXX XXXX ). On XXXX I sent PNC the early termination fee and a message to clear and remove from the books line of credit ... XXXX. PNC 's Response was to FAX or mail a letter to them with this request so I mailed the request certified mail. In two weeks I called PNC again and was informed that they had not received my request. When I told them that I had a receipt stamped by their receiver the customer service person put me on hold and transferred me to another customer service person. This transferring me around took me through XXXX other operators. With the third XXXX I ended the call and told the operator that I was tired of being transferred around and would seek higher authority 's. \\nI feel that this bank is trying to force me to stay with them by making getting a loan at another bank so difficult. And that I just give up and get the loan at PNC.\n",

I had to pay off that amount before opening a new one with a balance of {$790.00}. The amount was paid in person, cash, in XXXX. Now in XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX I was charged {$460.00} for an offset as well as on XX/XX/XXXX charged {$520.00} for a total of {$970.00}. I was told there's also a remaining balance of {$270.00}. \\n\\nI have contacted every single person I can manage to get ahold of. The boss of one particular store with a job title of \" Business Analysts Supervisor/Account supervisor '' contacted me and told me that I could dispute the claim but there was no way they can reverse the offset. Also last week when I was in person they said they would do the exact same thing and nobody called me to give me an answer. I called back and spoke with the boss with a fancy long title. So I then called customer service. Since it was an offset they were unable to dispute it and said they would connect me to someone who could. I was connected with their Recovery department. The agent was not able to dispute the claim either. The only thing she noticed and was able to do was inquire and fill out an investigation of why I was being charged over the amount of the balance owed, which still doesn't solve the original problem of being charged 2x for something that was paid off in XXXX. \\n\\nI seriously need help here. Nobody at TD helps. Everyone says can't do anything about it. Nobody seems competent or in any real position of power to do anything. I have a scheduled call with the supervisor 's boss I had spoke to in the next 24 hours, \" Business Analyst Supervisor ''. Essentially I'm speaking to every supervisor, getting their job title and name, and asking for their supervisor since every person contradicts themself with no consistency. When asked if they can explain the charge in detail, I never get a direct answer. It's just, X amount from collections. Forgive me on this because I'm not quite sure but after a certain amount of time don't banks just sell their debt to the lowest bidder after 180 days or so? So would a third party actually own my debt as well? Five year later collections comes after me? It all makes zero sense and feels like white collar theft. \\n\\nWill I have to take legal action? I'm open to all advice please.\n",

It was a nightmare to begin with, but finally we closed in XXXX First payment was due in XXXX. When I got paid on XXXX XXXX I signed in to the website to pay my payment and noticed that it said XXXX XXXX was due date. I contacted Wells Fargo TWICE to verify without a doubt that I did not owe until XXXX XXXX. I was assured both times that I did not owe until XXXX XXXX so I paid off another debt and used the rest to buy things for our baby that is due XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX I get a delinquent tax notice in the mail, even though when we closed it was time to pay taxes and my escrow account had the funds in there AND with the refinance they set aside money as well. I contacted my county, they said that they were not paid. I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and was told that the check was mailed out on XXXX but it had not cleared. I contact XXXX Co again, and they have nothing. The next day, on XXXX XXXX, I get an email from XXXX Co that says they have been paid. I assumed the check was located. Then on XXXX XXXX I get an email from Wells Fargo saying my tax documents had been corrected. I sign on to the website to see what was corrected only to find that I am now 18 days late on my mortgage payment ( the one that is not supposed to be due until XXXX XXXX according to 2 different customer service reps - I still have the emails so its in writing ). I was also charged a late fee. It appears that they never actually paid my taxes like they said, instead they applied the tax money to the account. However, how would I know that when the activity shows the amount held out and they told me that they had sent it? Now I owe a payment that I can not pay until XXXX XXXX at which point I will still be one month behind, 30 days late, incur yet another late fee because XXXX will also be 30 days late and this will be a continuous cycle going forward, every month I will be 30 days late, every month I will pay a {$53.00} late fee, and every month it will continue to destroy my credit. None of this is because of my own actions. I took every measure to ensure that I was not spending money that I owed on that month. I was assured that through the refinance there was left over funds that were applied which is why that payment was not due.\n",

              "199390  Near the end of XXXX 2016 I opened a Citigold checking account with the promotion code : XXXX. The promotion offered XXXX AAdvantage miles after making {$1000.00} in debit card purchases and 1 or more qualifying bill payments for 2 consecutive calendar months. I completed the requirements on XXXX XXXX, 2016. A couple of weeks ago I realized that I still had not received my miles, so I called the Citigold customer service number. The service rep confirmed that the promotion was linked to my account and that I had met all of the requirements, but said that it could take up to 90 days ( after meeting requirements ) for the miles to post. That date would be XXXX/XXXX/16. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I still did not have the miles, so I called them again. The service rep could not figure out why I did not get the miles and escalated my case to be \" investigated ''. Today I received an email from them stating that I was not \" the individual to whom the offer was addressed ''. I called in again to ask about this and the customer service rep escalated my call to a supervisor ( XXXX, I think was his name ). I explained to him that I applied for the account online and even printed out the \" Promotion Disclosures '' which stated all the terms and conditions. He asked if it had my name on it, because then perhaps he could make an exception for me, but obviously it did not ; it was just a pop-up window. I explained that I did not have any screenshots or anything of the application with my name on it because that would be an insanely unsafe thing to do! He put me on hold and came back with the same response I got from everyone before : that I was not targeted for the offer. I told him that I was literally holding a printout of the Disclosures and in the Terms and Conditions, it states \" This offer is available to Citi/AAdvantage credit cardmembers who receive this communication. '' Well, at the time I had a Citi AAdvantage Gold XXXX, so everything seemed fine. XXXX told me that \" this communication '' was referring to a targeted offer. WHAT THE HECK??? If I am literally reading something and it says \" this communication '' without any other description, then the communication is what I am reading, right??? XXXX again told me No and that unfortunately the website ca n't tell who is or is n't the \" targeted customer. '' So that 's my fault??? The worst part is that I had made plans based on receiving these miles. I also was paying $ XXXX/month for the account over the last two months, all the while being told I would receive the miles by XXXX/XXXX/16. XXXX told me that the best he could do is close my account today and make sure I 'm not charged another {$30.00} in two days. Gee thanks. \\n\\nWhile I was on the phone with them, I did a web search and found that many people received their miles/points using the exact same application process I did, but that earlier this year Citi started rejecting the promo as they did in my case. I heard from several people that filed a complaint with the CFPB and were able to get their promo bonus. I told this to XXXX hoping he would keep me from having to compose this complaint, and he told me that Citi was granting the bonuses after complaints earlier, but now they 're fighting back harder because it 's costing them too much. Wait a sec -- so you 're telling me that not only did you start granting the miles/points because it was the right thing to do, but instead of honoring the promotion, you went the other way and are now fighting this even harder because it 's costing your company too much??? Insane!!! \\n\\nPLEASE help me.\n",

Immediately thereafter, and pursuant to CHL 's instructions ; we submitted our signed documents which we Faxed ( verified ) & Mailed. We immediately began paying the agreed upon amount FAITHFULLY/MONTHLY to present day. \\nIn XXXX CHL sent a foreclosure notice and when I called they indicated that they had not received the aforementioned documents before a XXXX deadline and they were therefore going to foreclose on our loan. CHL said they called and sent notifications BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE!!! as we only received a letter in XXXX stating the correct address to send our Bank Checks to as being XXXX not XXXX as I was sending the Bank Checks to the XXXX address as instructed by a representative which I spoke with. That is THE ONLY correspondence we received from CHL - for had they merely indicated that they did not receive said documents we would have immediately remedied the situation. \\nThe Bottom Line is CHL accepted and cashed our checks for several months now which in any court of law is validation of the contract between us. \\n\\nIt should be noted that throughout the process of being completely ignored by the XXXX XXXX XXXX after being transferred from XXXX XXXX Bank - the entire process of dealing with CHL was excruciatingly difficult - and mind you - I 'm a XXXX with an XXXX!!! CHL seemingly/purposefully made Loan Modification Process exceedingly difficult. They would send out the same packets of documentations time after time and oftentimes requesting information that had already long since been sent and verified as being received by follow up phone calls. And please do note that it more often the case that the representatives gave completely different explanations when compared to the documentation they sent out. \\n\\nOftentimes it seemed like we were dealing with several different disjointed companies when trying to communicate with CHL. No one had answers to seemingly simple questions concerning their documentation inquiries. \\n\\nIn perusing the online complaints it was readily understood that we were in an uphill battle in dealing with CHL, but nothing prepared us for how incompetent this organization was. \\n\\nXXXX can only hope and trust that they, like XXXX and other evil establishments, will be levied well-deserved punitive fines and fees for how they have mistreated their clients. \\n\\nReiterating : We complied with every request made of us - we were granted a loan modification - faithfully made our payments from XXXX through to XXXX - and then unexpectedly received notification that we were being foreclosed on - without a single phone call/message or registered letter which one would think would be well warranted in a situation like this. CHL sent us NOTHING save for an address correction for payment! \\n\\nFor if we had XXXX iota of an indication that there was a discrepancy we would have moved heaven and earth to remedy the situation. \\n\\nWith all that being said, we want to thank you for your time and efforts on our behalf as we are truly at your mercy against an unmovable object. \\n\\nGratefully yours, XXXX\n",

The car fax indicated car had no history of acci- dents. Being a senior citizen I was looking for reliable fairly new transport- tation. On XX/XX/XXXX the front XXXX bumpers were disconnected from the body of ccar car. I immediately phoned Drivetime and was told to call the Warranty com- pany from which I purchased an extended service. I was told to take the car to ] XXXX XXXX where I was told they did not do this kind of work. XXXX told me that same day to then take the car to XXXX on XXXX. XXXX informed me after inspection that XXXX did not cover. However he was kind enough to bond both sides as a courtesy. This lasted approx. two month. XXXX XXXX also informed me and visually pointed out to me that the car had indeed been in an accident at some point. Someone had previously painted over to cover up scratches and dings. On XX/XX/XXXX I and my sister were perform- at our nephews wedding. Dressed in formal attire, the bumpers not only came aloo a part again as well as the plastic near wheel wells to protect from water in - undercarriage. It was horrendous that XXXX are on the berm attempting to XXXX glue car parts enough to get the car to safety. Drivetime/ XXXX was called on that Monday, and they agreed to have XXXX glue it with a h {$100.00} deductible. It stayed done for another month or so. There have been numerous problems with the car, however it does not qualify for the lemon law as I as it is a fairly new auto. Not other time has Drivetime/XXXX who I believe is one company has approved a repair. I have been to XXXX XXXX for me- canicle problems, denied. Recently the car went out of control. I was advised to to take auto to XXXX and found it was {$690.00} invoice for Stuts. I was de- nide. The car is a piece of junk. These are just a few of the problems. I have been consistent with upkeep, oil change, new tires, alignment etc. But I was in- formed that I did n't do enough because of high milage. I am retired. I drive to another city to visit my sister often due to her suffering a lose of family memb ber. I have since contacted XXXX and was given a case number when I ex- plain the difficulties I am having with the bumper etc,. I informed them that I had recently rented a XXXX XXXX XXXX and the bumper was disconnected as is my nieces XXXX XXXX. They are at least appearing concerned. I spoke with Drivetime on XX/XX/XXXX re : the latest problem and was told that al- though XXXX denied claim they wanted me to send in the receipts from XXXX, letter explaining problems and they would possibly be able to assist with repair. I have never missed a payment. I mailed it in and never heard anything else. On XX/XX/XXXX I called and they said it was never received and if it went to the address on company letter head, it was probably tossed. I gave the information over the phone and was told they would contact XXXX and get back to me in 24 hrs. Well needless to say, I have heard nothing. \\nThey come off as a real friend to people with credit problems but it is a front to get your business and then they drop the ball. It took me calling the XXXX on XXXX to get them to cancel that terrible warranty after asking since XX/XX/XXXX and of course they never got the written request. I am too old to have to fight fight with this company and all they ever say is \" we 're reaching out to you '' Please help. I am stuck with an undriveable piece of junk that I pay {$410.00} a month for. Sincerely.\n",

Left me his only son all his belongings, he was also single. \\nMy mother, his ex wife since XX/XX/XXXX, and he remained friends and she stayed with him in his house his last XXXX years of his life to help care for him. My mother, unknown to me at the time, was presenting herself to al of my father 's creditors as his \" wife ''. My father right before his death made it clear to me he was not agreeable to being presented to anyone as husband and wife regarding my mother for any reason. \\nUpon the time of my father 's death me and my family were living in a leased home. My mother qualified and received my fathers social security since they had been married XXXX years ( XXXX ). She stayed in the house and made the payment until I and my family were able to complete our lease on our home and move into my father 's home, as he and we wanted. I completed a probate since my father had no will and was single. \\nMy mother moved out of the home and I started taking over the payments. Then I was laid off work. When I initally contacted the mortgage company they informed me they were unable to speak to me because in their records they had that XXXX XXXX ( my mother ) was the righful owner of the house since my father passed. I had to explain she was not his wife. I sent them all the correlative documents. I asked for a deferrment of a payment, they said no because i was not the mortgage holder. Next they started transferring my account to different locations of their \" servicing centers '' and each time I would go through the whole explanation of who I was and have to send the documentation again. All the while sending the documentation to their corporate office and speaking with them. At XXXX point I set up auto withdrawal, they would do that. The XXXX XXXX did n't go through my account because their system wanted to withdraw at XXXX and my salary did n't deposit into my account until XXXX XXXX. At this point they would n't take a check from me. All the while I am requesting a modification of the loan. Each time my account was transferred to a new \" servicing center '' their employee would tell me to send a voided check and signature to authorize automatic withdrawal and I did each time. They never set it up. So in fear of the automatica withdraw suddently going into effect I refused to send more payments until someone would agree to something. They never would. \\nI just want to keep the house. Now that I have found the 12 CFR Part 1026 RIN 3170-ZA00 Application of REgulation Z 's Ability to Repay Rule to Certain Situations involving Successors in Interest, I believe the mortgage company violated this rule. I made it clear to the mortgage company I had every intention of keeping the home and paying the mortgage. Now they have filed foreclosure. This rule really hit home with me when I read it, because talking to several different people with Citifiancial I had some ask me why I did n't ask for a modification and then others tell me that a modification was n't possible! It appears it was all along. \\nLastly, my wife ( XXXX XXXX ) and I have Power of Attorneys on each other and she has permission to speak to anyone regarding anything pertaining to these matters. \\nI am attaching the foreclosure petition and our answer, death cert, probate, power of attorneys and correspondence i have had with the mortgage company.\n",

The boss of one particular store with a job title of \" Business Analysts Supervisor/Account supervisor '' contacted me and told me that I could dispute the claim but there was no way they can reverse the offset. Also last week when I was in person they said they would do the exact same thing and nobody called me to give me an answer. I called back and spoke with the boss with a fancy long title. So I then called customer service. Since it was an offset they were unable to dispute it and said they would connect me to someone who could. I was connected with their Recovery department. The agent was not able to dispute the claim either. The only thing she noticed and was able to do was inquire and fill out an investigation of why I was being charged over the amount of the balance owed, which still doesn't solve the original problem of being charged 2x for something that was paid off in XXXX. \\n\\nI seriously need help here. Nobody at TD helps. Everyone says can't do anything about it. Nobody seems competent or in any real position of power to do anything. I have a scheduled call with the supervisor 's boss I had spoke to in the next 24 hours, \" Business Analyst Supervisor ''. Essentially I'm speaking to every supervisor, getting their job title and name, and asking for their supervisor since every person contradicts themself with no consistency. When asked if they can explain the charge in detail, I never get a direct answer. It's just, X amount from collections. Forgive me on this because I'm not quite sure but after a certain amount of time don't banks just sell their debt to the lowest bidder after 180 days or so? So would a third party actually own my debt as well? Five year later collections comes after me? It all makes zero sense and feels like white collar theft. \\n\\nWill I have to take legal action?

When I got paid on XXXX XXXX I signed in to the website to pay my payment and noticed that it said XXXX XXXX was due date. I contacted Wells Fargo TWICE to verify without a doubt that I did not owe until XXXX XXXX. I was assured both times that I did not owe until XXXX XXXX so I paid off another debt and used the rest to buy things for our baby that is due XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX I get a delinquent tax notice in the mail, even though when we closed it was time to pay taxes and my escrow account had the funds in there AND with the refinance they set aside money as well. I contacted my county, they said that they were not paid. I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and was told that the check was mailed out on XXXX but it had not cleared. I contact XXXX Co again, and they have nothing. The next day, on XXXX XXXX, I get an email from XXXX Co that says they have been paid. I assumed the check was located. Then on XXXX XXXX I get an email from Wells Fargo saying my tax documents had been corrected. I sign on to the website to see what was corrected only to find that I am now 18 days late on my mortgage payment ( the one that is not supposed to be due until XXXX XXXX according to 2 different customer service reps - I still have the emails so its in writing ). I was also charged a late fee. It appears that they never actually paid my taxes like they said, instead they applied the tax money to the account. However, how would I know that when the activity shows the amount held out and they told me that they had sent it? Now I owe a payment that I can not pay until XXXX XXXX at which point I will still be one month behind, 30 days late, incur yet another late fee because XXXX will also be 30 days late and this will be a continuous cycle going forward, every month I will be 30 days late, every month I will pay a {$53.00} late fee, and every month it will continue to destroy my credit. None of this is because of my own actions. I took every measure to ensure that I was not spending money that I owed on that month. I was assured that through the refinance there was left over funds that were applied which is why that payment was not due.</td>\n",

The promotion offered XXXX AAdvantage miles after making {$1000.00} in debit card purchases and 1 or more qualifying bill payments for 2 consecutive calendar months. I completed the requirements on XXXX XXXX, 2016. A couple of weeks ago I realized that I still had not received my miles, so I called the Citigold customer service number. The service rep confirmed that the promotion was linked to my account and that I had met all of the requirements, but said that it could take up to 90 days ( after meeting requirements ) for the miles to post. That date would be XXXX/XXXX/16. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I still did not have the miles, so I called them again. The service rep could not figure out why I did not get the miles and escalated my case to be \" investigated ''. Today I received an email from them stating that I was not \" the individual to whom the offer was addressed ''. I called in again to ask about this and the customer service rep escalated my call to a supervisor ( XXXX, I think was his name ). I explained to him that I applied for the account online and even printed out the \" Promotion Disclosures '' which stated all the terms and conditions. He asked if it had my name on it, because then perhaps he could make an exception for me, but obviously it did not ; it was just a pop-up window. I explained that I did not have any screenshots or anything of the application with my name on it because that would be an insanely unsafe thing to do! He put me on hold and came back with the same response I got from everyone before : that I was not targeted for the offer. I told him that I was literally holding a printout of the Disclosures and in the Terms and Conditions, it states \" This offer is available to Citi/AAdvantage credit cardmembers who receive this communication. '' Well, at the time I had a Citi AAdvantage Gold XXXX, so everything seemed fine. XXXX told me that \" this communication '' was referring to a targeted offer. WHAT THE HECK??? If I am literally reading something and it says \" this communication '' without any other description, then the communication is what I am reading, right??? XXXX again told me No and that unfortunately the website ca n't tell who is or is n't the \" targeted customer. '' So that 's my fault??? The worst part is that I had made plans based on receiving these miles. I also was paying $ XXXX/month for the account over the last two months, all the while being told I would receive the miles by XXXX/XXXX/16. XXXX told me that the best he could do is close my account today and make sure I 'm not charged another {$30.00} in two days. Gee thanks. \\n\\nWhile I was on the phone with them, I did a web search and found that many people received their miles/points using the exact same application process I did, but that earlier this year Citi started rejecting the promo as they did in my case. I heard from several people that filed a complaint with the CFPB and were able to get their promo bonus. I told this to XXXX hoping he would keep me from having to compose this complaint, and he told me that Citi was granting the bonuses after complaints earlier, but now they 're fighting back harder because it 's costing them too much. Wait a sec -- so you 're telling me that not only did you start granting the miles/points because it was the right thing to do, but instead of honoring the promotion, you went the other way and are now fighting this even harder because it 's costing your company too much??? Insane!!! \\n\\nPLEASE help me.</td>\n",

I immediately phoned Drivetime and was told to call the Warranty com- pany from which I purchased an extended service. I was told to take the car to ] XXXX XXXX where I was told they did not do this kind of work. XXXX told me that same day to then take the car to XXXX on XXXX. XXXX informed me after inspection that XXXX did not cover. However he was kind enough to bond both sides as a courtesy. This lasted approx. two month. XXXX XXXX also informed me and visually pointed out to me that the car had indeed been in an accident at some point. Someone had previously painted over to cover up scratches and dings. On XX/XX/XXXX I and my sister were perform- at our nephews wedding. Dressed in formal attire, the bumpers not only came aloo a part again as well as the plastic near wheel wells to protect from water in - undercarriage. It was horrendous that XXXX are on the berm attempting to XXXX glue car parts enough to get the car to safety. Drivetime/ XXXX was called on that Monday, and they agreed to have XXXX glue it with a h {$100.00} deductible. It stayed done for another month or so. There have been numerous problems with the car, however it does not qualify for the lemon law as I as it is a fairly new auto. Not other time has Drivetime/XXXX who I believe is one company has approved a repair. I have been to XXXX XXXX for me- canicle problems, denied. Recently the car went out of control. I was advised to to take auto to XXXX and found it was {$690.00} invoice for Stuts. I was de- nide. The car is a piece of junk. These are just a few of the problems. I have been consistent with upkeep, oil change, new tires, alignment etc. But I was in- formed that I did n't do enough because of high milage. I am retired. I drive to another city to visit my sister often due to her suffering a lose of family memb ber. I have since contacted XXXX and was given a case number when I ex- plain the difficulties I am having with the bumper etc,. I informed them that I had recently rented a XXXX XXXX XXXX and the bumper was disconnected as is my nieces XXXX XXXX. They are at least appearing concerned. I spoke with Drivetime on XX/XX/XXXX re : the latest problem and was told that al- though XXXX denied claim they wanted me to send in the receipts from XXXX, letter explaining problems and they would possibly be able to assist with repair. I have never missed a payment. I mailed it in and never heard anything else. On XX/XX/XXXX I called and they said it was never received and if it went to the address on company letter head, it was probably tossed. I gave the information over the phone and was told they would contact XXXX and get back to me in 24 hrs. Well needless to say, I have heard nothing. \\nThey come off as a real friend to people with credit problems but it is a front to get your business and then they drop the ball. It took me calling the XXXX on XXXX to get them to cancel that terrible warranty after asking since XX/XX/XXXX and of course they never got the written request.

My mother, unknown to me at the time, was presenting herself to al of my father 's creditors as his \" wife ''. My father right before his death made it clear to me he was not agreeable to being presented to anyone as husband and wife regarding my mother for any reason. \\nUpon the time of my father 's death me and my family were living in a leased home. My mother qualified and received my fathers social security since they had been married XXXX years ( XXXX ). She stayed in the house and made the payment until I and my family were able to complete our lease on our home and move into my father 's home, as he and we wanted. I completed a probate since my father had no will and was single. \\nMy mother moved out of the home and I started taking over the payments. Then I was laid off work. When I initally contacted the mortgage company they informed me they were unable to speak to me because in their records they had that XXXX XXXX ( my mother ) was the righful owner of the house since my father passed. I had to explain she was not his wife. I sent them all the correlative documents. I asked for a deferrment of a payment, they said no because i was not the mortgage holder. Next they started transferring my account to different locations of their \" servicing centers '' and each time I would go through the whole explanation of who I was and have to send the documentation again. All the while sending the documentation to their corporate office and speaking with them. At XXXX point I set up auto withdrawal, they would do that. The XXXX XXXX did n't go through my account because their system wanted to withdraw at XXXX and my salary did n't deposit into my account until XXXX XXXX. At this point they would n't take a check from me. All the while I am requesting a modification of the loan. Each time my account was transferred to a new \" servicing center '' their employee would tell me to send a voided check and signature to authorize automatic withdrawal and I did each time. They never set it up. So in fear of the automatica withdraw suddently going into effect I refused to send more payments until someone would agree to something. They never would. \\nI just want to keep the house. Now that I have found the 12 CFR Part 1026 RIN 3170-ZA00 Application of REgulation Z 's Ability to Repay Rule to Certain Situations involving Successors in Interest, I believe the mortgage company violated this rule. I made it clear to the mortgage company I had every intention of keeping the home and paying the mortgage. Now they have filed foreclosure. This rule really hit home with me when I read it, because talking to several different people with Citifiancial I had some ask me why I did n't ask for a modification and then others tell me that a modification was n't possible! It appears it was all along. \\nLastly, my wife ( XXXX XXXX ) and I have Power of Attorneys on each other and she has permission to speak to anyone regarding anything pertaining to these matters. \\nI am attaching the foreclosure petition and our answer, death cert, probate, power of attorneys and correspondence i have had with the mortgage company.</td>\n",

PayPal put a limited access tag on my account, I received ZERO NOTICE of this. PayPal is asking me for receipts of items from a distributor I sell on EBay but I do not have receipts as all  these items were bought by me on XXXX over the past 20 years. I am simply unloading/selling a collection of rock patches that average about {$9.00} a piece. I do not operate a business on XXXX. I have perfect 100 % + positive feedback on XXXX too, so there should be no need for PayPal to limit my account. By limiting my account, PayPal will not allow me to withdraw that funds I have in my PayPal account. I tried calling PayPal but when you hear the automated system state there is a wait time of 1 hour to 2 hours and they are going to transfer you to put you in line to wait for a customer service agent, PayPal then drops the call or in other words PayPal hangs up on you. There is zero way to resolve the matter online or over the phone then.\n",

Upon completion, I began to pay back the loan ( in XXXX XXXX ). There were XXXX private loans total with XXXX. In XXXX XXXX, Citi sold XXXX of the loans to XXXX. I began to make payments to XXXX, however in late XXXX, due to financial problems, I was unable to make the ballooned payments. I eventually worked out a payment plan with XXXX in XXXX XXXX. We set up a repayment plan for both of my loans with XXXX. XXXX withdrew directly from my checking account to post towards the loan. However, in XXXX, while still on my repayment plan, Citi took XXXX of the loans back and I was not notified by either XXXX or Citi. During the past year ( from XXXX XXXX XXXX ), I was unaware that Citi had taken the loan back. XXXX continued to withdraw money from my account for the repayment plan. I was also still paying back a loan with Citi and I never saw the second loan on my loan account. It was n't until I ran a credit report on myself in XXXX XXXX that I noticed I had a \" Charge Off '' loan with Citi. When I contacted them to ask why, they said they took the loan back from XXXX due to delinquency ( even though I already had an agreement in place with XXXX ) to pay the loan. Even though Citi took the loan back, they never contacted me for an entire year regarding the loan. When I spoke to Citi 's Recovery Department, they informed me that they would send the loan to a collections agency to process. I asked if I could just arrange a payment plan with them now since I was never aware of the loan. They said no. In XXXX, I was contacted by a collection agency to begin collecting on my loan. I am in complete disbelief that neither XXXX nor Citi notified me of a loan that was in limbo for an entire year. Now, it has ruined my credit. I have submitted a letter requesting that Citi take back the loan from the collection agency and process it themselves and allow me the opportunity to make the payment directly to Citi. I have also requested that they reverse all the negative action on my credit report.\n",

Each time they have called the bank to check on the modification they were advised that they did n't have authorization. I have given XXXX authorization which has been sent to the bank on multiple times. The bank advised they had received the authorization on XX/XX/XXXX and then on XX/XX/XXXX they said they did n't have. This has left me in a terrible hardship and I 'm may lose my home. I lost my wife on XX/XX/XXXX. She battled XXXX for five years. Not only have I had to endure watching my wife suffer and leave this world I may now have to leave our home that we shared together. My son and I live in the home and very much want to continue living here. The bank has advised that there is a sale date for my home on XX/XX/XXXX. My son and I have no where to go.\n",

The charge is from XXXX and is under the name XXXX XXXX. I noticed the charge on XXXX/XXXX/15 and immediately called to file a dispute. I received the paperwork to sign and returned it on XXXX/XXXX/15. The paperwork I signed was an affidavit that it was not my charge. I immediately placed the signed affidavit back in the mail in the postage paid envelope provided. I called on XXXX/XXXX/15 to find out when I would receive my provisional credit and I was told after 10 business days of the complaint. When talking with the customer service representative, we both agreed the credit would be posted to my account on XXXX/XXXX/15. She told me it would be later in the day. So, on XXXX/XXXX/15 at XXXX. I contacted Associated Bank to find out why I had not received the provisional credit. At that time I was told my signed paperwork was not received. I was also told the dispute area was closed so they would have to call me on Monday. And that I would not get provisional credit until 10 days AFTER the signed paperwork was received. They said they would re-mail me the documents for me to sign and it would be an additional 10 days AFTER they receive those documents that I would receive provisional credit! \\nIt looks like the charge to my account is an ACH transaction that obviously was taken from the wrong account. Maybe {$350.00} is not a lot of money to them, but I need the {$350.00} that was incorrectly taken from my account to pay bills. The bank refuses to give me credit to the money that is mine.\n",

I told the rep then that I have n't done anything in my account and did n't recognize any of the transactions from the particular account they were referring to. ( At the time I had  XXXX  accounts wit h Chase ).  So that 's when I realized that I had lost my debt card and also informed the rep of this as well. Not only were they able to gain access to my online banking but also made changes on my account. On this same date  XXXX  check deposits were made for {$740.00} and {$760.00}, then on  XXXX   XXXX ,  2015   XXXX  more check deposits were made of {$740.00} and {$740.00}. Which were desposited via ATM in  XXXX , IL, I live in  XXXX   XXXX , NJ. They were some construction company checks that I 've never heard of.     In my account at that time was my rent amount of {$1500.00}, which was taken out via ATM withdrawal on  XXXX   XXXX ,    2015. On ce these checks were in the account they withdrew the monies as money orders for those same amounts listed above. I went back and forth with Chase for almost a week signing documents, questionnaires and dealing with some supervisors over the phone with nothing to be accomplished.     Even until after the holidays I was n't able to get this matter resolved until they finally decided that they were going to close all of my accounts with Chase and not be refunded {$1500.00} the monies that was withdrawn from my account at the time the whole fraud case began. But they are also penalizing me for monies owed to them in the amount of {$2300.00}. And wo n't be able to do business with them for the next 7 years\n",

I have left a message to collect stolen funds {$9800.00} plus 20 % interest, $ XXXX ( XXXX hrs ), all related fees as well as trauma, pain, suffering brought by Bank of America for illegally release consumer 's deposit on XX/XX/XXXX. I received NO any response for this debt collection call against Bank of America and theft XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I personally stopped at one of banks branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX to speak with XXXX XXXX. She treated me badly ( discrimination ) by providing NO service compare with other customer. I have complained about that I have to recover my stolen funds immediately because this theft activity happened since XX/XX/XXXX. Now its been 5 years and bank of america totally ignore my several complaints filed to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). In XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I have complained same matter to Bank of America 's XXXX branch for several times. On XX/XX/XXXX I have spoken with CFPB 's representative XXXX to ask assistance in order to recover stolen funds. I have clearly expressed my position : I NEVER authorized bank of america to release my deposit to a unknown theft such as XXXX XXXX ; I NEVER authorized anyone to represent me to do any banking transaction. I NEVER authorized XXXX XXXX to handle my bank account such as open new account, withdrawl funds, close accounts, obtain my personal identity, etc. In one word, I already notified law enforcement agency such as FTC, local police department, FBI, U.S. district court, State of Maryland circuit court to prosecute theft XXXX XXXX. This theft lied to the court and public : She can not handle my personal affair at all. She can only bring me damages, losses, pain, suffering, trauma, anxiety by losing my deposit. I once again ask bank of america to honor 5 cashier 's checks issued on XX/XX/XXXX due to bank 's stop payment. Cashier 's check was considering as cash and was guaranteed to pay. I am so upset that Bank of America has no any business credit at all. And can not protect consumer 's deposit. Because of this bank 's criminal activity, I lost trust toward XXXX XXXX  's practice. Please do not spread your financial crisis to me as totally irrelavent party. I have no any reason to accept such type of financial crime and deprive my rights committed by both Bank of America, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX County Circuit Court in Maryland ).\n",

This has happened several times, but this time I took screen shots of the page. On XXXX/XXXX/2016, prior to making a payment of {$300.00}, my balance was {$34.00}, XXXX and today ( XXXX/XXXX/2016 ) after posting my payment of {$300.00}, my balance is {$34.00}, XXXX. Previously, when I have contacted customer service at Navient about this, I did not have the screen shots to prove my balance increased and now I do. Kindly advise me on what to do about this as it appears to be an ongoing issue that may have been costing me money I do not owe. I am happy to provide the screenshots as well. Thank you, XXXX XXXX\n",
              "68202   I am in need of your assistance please. My wife and I purchased a house in XXXX while we were XXXX, and as you know the market collapsed shortly thereafter. In XX/XX/XXXX I XXXX was forced to leave my family behind to continue trying to sell our house. After a couple months of nothing, and an upcoming XXXX to XXXX we decided to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time for assistance, and they said they would n't help us so we had to leave the house as is. \\nAfter being in XXXX for a couple months a friend of mine moved into our house, and I took out a loan from my Grandfather to get caught up on the house. We than got a long term resident in the house with intentions to purchase the house from us after settling some things from his last house. We got stationed in XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX where we lived until XX/XX/XXXX. \\nIn XXXX XXXX our renter up and left the house leaving us with no notice or anything. My wife 's paycheck was going strictly towards the house for 7 months until my wife had to quit because of orders taking us to XXXX where we are currently stationed. While we tried with the bank to do a short sale, we were getting the run around which was very difficult being in XXXX, and it did n't seem like the VA was helping us get the documents loaded into the system, and I had to make daily calls for a week at a time to make sure things were getting done, and after about a month we got an offer on our house that was very good. I called Nationstar and the VA again almost on a weekly basis to try and get the house sold. After well over 90 days of waiting on the bank and making constant phone calls, there was a really bad storm in XXXX where rain had got in the basement and our sump pump went out. We were than notified that there was mold damage now, and the buyers backed out, and we do n't have the means to get the mold fixed, and the bank said they would not pay for it. \\nSo now the only thing I could think of was a Deed in Lieu, to try to get this house out of my name and try to rebuild my credit. I submitted paperwork to the bank 2 weeks ago, and since then have been contacted by the bank 4 times asking about the short sale, and how that process was going. Each time I had to explain again that I had submitted the paperwork to do a Deed in Lieu. \\nI am now convinced that if personnel that work at this bank and handled my account had done their job my house would have sold when we did the short sale, and they should be held accountable for what they have done. If this is happening to me and my family I ca n't help but think if there are other Soldiers and families going through the same difficulties as I am. As a XXXX I had to try to reach out to someone in a position to make a difference not only for me but also for what could be numerous Soldiers and their families that are going through the same problems. \\nThank you for your time Sincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n",

My home value is listed as {$130000.00} and I currently owe {$100000.00} on my loan. That means my LTV is currently at 77.90 %. I am below the FHA required 78 % to remove the PMI from my FHA loan. I have already submitted my request in writing to Suntrust Mortgage, however they're insisting that my LTV is still sitting at 83.83 % and can not tell me how they keep coming to that calculation. I have even received automated text messaged from Suntrust regarding my loan saying I'm below the 78 % LTV.\n",

I have submitted a letter requesting that Citi take back the loan from the collection agency and process it themselves and allow me the opportunity to make the payment directly to Citi.

I received NO any response for this debt collection call against Bank of America and theft XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I personally stopped at one of banks branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX to speak with XXXX XXXX. She treated me badly ( discrimination ) by providing NO service compare with other customer. I have complained about that I have to recover my stolen funds immediately because this theft activity happened since XX/XX/XXXX. Now its been 5 years and bank of america totally ignore my several complaints filed to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). In XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I have complained same matter to Bank of America 's XXXX branch for several times. On XX/XX/XXXX I have spoken with CFPB 's representative XXXX to ask assistance in order to recover stolen funds. I have clearly expressed my position : I NEVER authorized bank of america to release my deposit to a unknown theft such as XXXX XXXX ; I NEVER authorized anyone to represent me to do any banking transaction. I NEVER authorized XXXX XXXX to handle my bank account such as open new account, withdrawl funds, close accounts, obtain my personal identity, etc. In one word, I already notified law enforcement agency such as FTC, local police department, FBI, U.S. district court, State of Maryland circuit court to prosecute theft XXXX XXXX. This theft lied to the court and public : She can not handle my personal affair at all. She can only bring me damages, losses, pain, suffering, trauma, anxiety by losing my deposit. I once again ask bank of america to honor 5 cashier 's checks issued on XX/XX/XXXX due to bank 's stop payment. Cashier 's check was considering as cash and was guaranteed to pay. I am so upset that Bank of America has no any business credit at all. And can not protect consumer 's deposit. Because of this bank 's criminal activity, I lost trust toward XXXX XXXX  's practice. Please do not spread your financial crisis to me as totally irrelavent party.

After a couple months of nothing, and an upcoming XXXX to XXXX we decided to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time for assistance, and they said they would n't help us so we had to leave the house as is. \\nAfter being in XXXX for a couple months a friend of mine moved into our house, and I took out a loan from my Grandfather to get caught up on the house. We than got a long term resident in the house with intentions to purchase the house from us after settling some things from his last house. We got stationed in XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX where we lived until XX/XX/XXXX. \\nIn XXXX XXXX our renter up and left the house leaving us with no notice or anything. My wife 's paycheck was going strictly towards the house for 7 months until my wife had to quit because of orders taking us to XXXX where we are currently stationed. While we tried with the bank to do a short sale, we were getting the run around which was very difficult being in XXXX, and it did n't seem like the VA was helping us get the documents loaded into the system, and I had to make daily calls for a week at a time to make sure things were getting done, and after about a month we got an offer on our house that was very good. I called Nationstar and the VA again almost on a weekly basis to try and get the house sold. After well over 90 days of waiting on the bank and making constant phone calls, there was a really bad storm in XXXX where rain had got in the basement and our sump pump went out. We were than notified that there was mold damage now, and the buyers backed out, and we do n't have the means to get the mold fixed, and the bank said they would not pay for it. \\nSo now the only thing I could think of was a Deed in Lieu, to try to get this house out of my name and try to rebuild my credit. I submitted paperwork to the bank 2 weeks ago, and since then have been contacted by the bank 4 times asking about the short sale, and how that process was going. Each time I had to explain again that I had submitted the paperwork to do a Deed in Lieu. \\nI am now convinced that if personnel that work at this bank and handled my account had done their job my house would have sold when we did the short sale, and they should be held accountable for what they have done. If this is happening to me and my family I ca n't help but think if there are other Soldiers and families going through the same difficulties as I am. As a XXXX I had to try to reach out to someone in a position to make a difference not only for me but also for what could be numerous Soldiers and their families that are going through the same problems. \\nThank you for your time Sincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX</td>\n",

PayPal put a limited access tag on my account, I received ZERO NOTICE of this. PayPal is asking me for receipts of items from a distributor I sell on EBay but I do not have receipts as all  these items were bought by me on XXXX over the past 20 years. I am simply unloading/selling a collection of rock patches that average about {$9.00} a piece. I do not operate a business on XXXX. I have perfect 100 % + positive feedback on XXXX too, so there should be no need for PayPal to limit my account. By limiting my account, PayPal will not allow me to withdraw that funds I have in my PayPal account. I tried calling PayPal but when you hear the automated system state there is a wait time of 1 hour to 2 hours and they are going to transfer you to put you in line to wait for a customer service agent, PayPal then drops the call or in other words PayPal hangs up on you. There is zero way to resolve the matter online or over the phone then.  \n",

Upon completion, I began to pay back the loan ( in XXXX XXXX ). There were XXXX private loans total with XXXX. In XXXX XXXX, Citi sold XXXX of the loans to XXXX. I began to make payments to XXXX, however in late XXXX, due to financial problems, I was unable to make the ballooned payments. I eventually worked out a payment plan with XXXX in XXXX XXXX. We set up a repayment plan for both of my loans with XXXX. XXXX withdrew directly from my checking account to post towards the loan. However, in XXXX, while still on my repayment plan, Citi took XXXX of the loans back and I was not notified by either XXXX or Citi. During the past year ( from XXXX XXXX XXXX ), I was unaware that Citi had taken the loan back. XXXX continued to withdraw money from my account for the repayment plan. I was also still paying back a loan with Citi and I never saw the second loan on my loan account. It was n't until I ran a credit report on myself in XXXX XXXX that I noticed I had a \" Charge Off '' loan with Citi. When I contacted them to ask why, they said they took the loan back from XXXX due to delinquency ( even though I already had an agreement in place with XXXX ) to pay the loan. Even though Citi took the loan back, they never contacted me for an entire year regarding the loan. When I spoke to Citi 's Recovery Department, they informed me that they would send the loan to a collections agency to process. I asked if I could just arrange a payment plan with them now since I was never aware of the loan. They said no. In XXXX, I was contacted by a collection agency to begin collecting on my loan. I am in complete disbelief that neither XXXX nor Citi notified me of a loan that was in limbo for an entire year. Now, it has ruined my credit. I have submitted a letter requesting that Citi take back the loan from the collection agency and process it themselves and allow me the opportunity to make the payment directly to Citi. I have also requested that they reverse all the negative action on my credit report.  \n",

Each time they have called the bank to check on the modification they were advised that they did n't have authorization. I have given XXXX authorization which has been sent to the bank on multiple times. The bank advised they had received the authorization on XX/XX/XXXX and then on XX/XX/XXXX they said they did n't have. This has left me in a terrible hardship and I 'm may lose my home. I lost my wife on XX/XX/XXXX. She battled XXXX for five years. Not only have I had to endure watching my wife suffer and leave this world I may now have to leave our home that we shared together. My son and I live in the home and very much want to continue living here. The bank has advised that there is a sale date for my home on XX/XX/XXXX. My son and I have no where to go.  \n",

The charge is from XXXX and is under the name XXXX XXXX. I noticed the charge on XXXX/XXXX/15 and immediately called to file a dispute. I received the paperwork to sign and returned it on XXXX/XXXX/15. The paperwork I signed was an affidavit that it was not my charge. I immediately placed the signed affidavit back in the mail in the postage paid envelope provided. I called on XXXX/XXXX/15 to find out when I would receive my provisional credit and I was told after 10 business days of the complaint. When talking with the customer service representative, we both agreed the credit would be posted to my account on XXXX/XXXX/15. She told me it would be later in the day. So, on XXXX/XXXX/15 at XXXX. I contacted Associated Bank to find out why I had not received the provisional credit. At that time I was told my signed paperwork was not received. I was also told the dispute area was closed so they would have to call me on Monday. And that I would not get provisional credit until 10 days AFTER the signed paperwork was received. They said they would re-mail me the documents for me to sign and it would be an additional 10 days AFTER they receive those documents that I would receive provisional credit! \\nIt looks like the charge to my account is an ACH transaction that obviously was taken from the wrong account. Maybe {$350.00} is not a lot of money to them, but I need the {$350.00} that was incorrectly taken from my account to pay bills. The bank refuses to give me credit to the money that is mine.  \n",

I told the rep then that I have n't done anything in my account and did n't recognize any of the transactions from the particular account they were referring to. ( At the time I had  XXXX  accounts wit h Chase ).  So that 's when I realized that I had lost my debt card and also informed the rep of this as well. Not only were they able to gain access to my online banking but also made changes on my account. On this same date  XXXX  check deposits were made for {$740.00} and {$760.00}, then on  XXXX   XXXX ,  2015   XXXX  more check deposits were made of {$740.00} and {$740.00}. Which were desposited via ATM in  XXXX , IL, I live in  XXXX   XXXX , NJ. They were some construction company checks that I 've never heard of.     In my account at that time was my rent amount of {$1500.00}, which was taken out via ATM withdrawal on  XXXX   XXXX ,    2015. On ce these checks were in the account they withdrew the monies as money orders for those same amounts listed above. I went back and forth with Chase for almost a week signing documents, questionnaires and dealing with some supervisors over the phone with nothing to be accomplished.     Even until after the holidays I was n't able to get this matter resolved until they finally decided that they were going to close all of my accounts with Chase and not be refunded {$1500.00} the monies that was withdrawn from my account at the time the whole fraud case began. But they are also penalizing me for monies owed to them in the amount of {$2300.00}. And wo n't be able to do business with them for the next 7 years  \n",

I have left a message to collect stolen funds {$9800.00} plus 20 % interest, $ XXXX ( XXXX hrs ), all related fees as well as trauma, pain, suffering brought by Bank of America for illegally release consumer 's deposit on XX/XX/XXXX. I received NO any response for this debt collection call against Bank of America and theft XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I personally stopped at one of banks branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX to speak with XXXX XXXX. She treated me badly ( discrimination ) by providing NO service compare with other customer. I have complained about that I have to recover my stolen funds immediately because this theft activity happened since XX/XX/XXXX. Now its been 5 years and bank of america totally ignore my several complaints filed to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). In XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I have complained same matter to Bank of America 's XXXX branch for several times. On XX/XX/XXXX I have spoken with CFPB 's representative XXXX to ask assistance in order to recover stolen funds. I have clearly expressed my position : I NEVER authorized bank of america to release my deposit to a unknown theft such as XXXX XXXX ; I NEVER authorized anyone to represent me to do any banking transaction. I NEVER authorized XXXX XXXX to handle my bank account such as open new account, withdrawl funds, close accounts, obtain my personal identity, etc. In one word, I already notified law enforcement agency such as FTC, local police department, FBI, U.S. district court, State of Maryland circuit court to prosecute theft XXXX XXXX. This theft lied to the court and public : She can not handle my personal affair at all. She can only bring me damages, losses, pain, suffering, trauma, anxiety by losing my deposit. I once again ask bank of america to honor 5 cashier 's checks issued on XX/XX/XXXX due to bank 's stop payment. Cashier 's check was considering as cash and was guaranteed to pay. I am so upset that Bank of America has no any business credit at all. And can not protect consumer 's deposit. Because of this bank 's criminal activity, I lost trust toward XXXX XXXX  's practice. Please do not spread your financial crisis to me as totally irrelavent party. I have no any reason to accept such type of financial crime and deprive my rights committed by both Bank of America, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX County Circuit Court in Maryland ).  \n",

This has happened several times, but this time I took screen shots of the page. On XXXX/XXXX/2016, prior to making a payment of {$300.00}, my balance was {$34.00}, XXXX and today ( XXXX/XXXX/2016 ) after posting my payment of {$300.00}, my balance is {$34.00}, XXXX. Previously, when I have contacted customer service at Navient about this, I did not have the screen shots to prove my balance increased and now I do. Kindly advise me on what to do about this as it appears to be an ongoing issue that may have been costing me money I do not owe. I am happy to provide the screenshots as well. Thank you, XXXX XXXX  \n",
              "68202   I am in need of your assistance please. My wife and I purchased a house in XXXX while we were XXXX, and as you know the market collapsed shortly thereafter. In XX/XX/XXXX I XXXX was forced to leave my family behind to continue trying to sell our house. After a couple months of nothing, and an upcoming XXXX to XXXX we decided to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time for assistance, and they said they would n't help us so we had to leave the house as is. \\nAfter being in XXXX for a couple months a friend of mine moved into our house, and I took out a loan from my Grandfather to get caught up on the house. We than got a long term resident in the house with intentions to purchase the house from us after settling some things from his last house. We got stationed in XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX where we lived until XX/XX/XXXX. \\nIn XXXX XXXX our renter up and left the house leaving us with no notice or anything. My wife 's paycheck was going strictly towards the house for 7 months until my wife had to quit because of orders taking us to XXXX where we are currently stationed. While we tried with the bank to do a short sale, we were getting the run around which was very difficult being in XXXX, and it did n't seem like the VA was helping us get the documents loaded into the system, and I had to make daily calls for a week at a time to make sure things were getting done, and after about a month we got an offer on our house that was very good. I called Nationstar and the VA again almost on a weekly basis to try and get the house sold. After well over 90 days of waiting on the bank and making constant phone calls, there was a really bad storm in XXXX where rain had got in the basement and our sump pump went out. We were than notified that there was mold damage now, and the buyers backed out, and we do n't have the means to get the mold fixed, and the bank said they would not pay for it. \\nSo now the only thing I could think of was a Deed in Lieu, to try to get this house out of my name and try to rebuild my credit. I submitted paperwork to the bank 2 weeks ago, and since then have been contacted by the bank 4 times asking about the short sale, and how that process was going. Each time I had to explain again that I had submitted the paperwork to do a Deed in Lieu. \\nI am now convinced that if personnel that work at this bank and handled my account had done their job my house would have sold when we did the short sale, and they should be held accountable for what they have done. If this is happening to me and my family I ca n't help but think if there are other Soldiers and families going through the same difficulties as I am. As a XXXX I had to try to reach out to someone in a position to make a difference not only for me but also for what could be numerous Soldiers and their families that are going through the same problems. \\nThank you for your time Sincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  \n",

My home value is listed as {$130000.00} and I currently owe {$100000.00} on my loan. That means my LTV is currently at 77.90 %. I am below the FHA required 78 % to remove the PMI from my FHA loan. I have already submitted my request in writing to Suntrust Mortgage, however they're insisting that my LTV is still sitting at 83.83 % and can not tell me how they keep coming to that calculation. I have even received automated text messaged from Suntrust regarding my loan saying I'm below the 78 % LTV.  \n",

It was n't until I ran a credit report on myself in XXXX XXXX that I noticed I had a \" Charge Off '' loan with Citi.

Even though Citi took the loan back, they never contacted me for an entire year regarding the loan. When I spoke to Citi 's Recovery Department, they informed me that they would send the loan to a collections agency to process. I asked if I could just arrange a payment plan with them now since I was never aware of the loan. They said no. In XXXX, I was contacted by a collection agency to begin collecting on my loan. I am in complete disbelief that neither XXXX nor Citi notified me of a loan that was in limbo for an entire year. Now, it has ruined my credit. I have submitted a letter requesting that Citi take back the loan from the collection agency and process it themselves and allow me the opportunity to make the payment directly to Citi.

I have left a message to collect stolen funds {$9800.00} plus 20 % interest, $ XXXX ( XXXX hrs ), all related fees as well as trauma, pain, suffering brought by Bank of America for illegally release consumer 's deposit on XX/XX/XXXX. I received NO any response for this debt collection call against Bank of America and theft XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I personally stopped at one of banks branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX to speak with XXXX XXXX. She treated me badly ( discrimination ) by providing NO service compare with other customer. I have complained about that I have to recover my stolen funds immediately because this theft activity happened since XX/XX/XXXX. Now its been 5 years and bank of america totally ignore my several complaints filed to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). In XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I have complained same matter to Bank of America 's XXXX branch for several times. On XX/XX/XXXX I have spoken with CFPB 's representative XXXX to ask assistance in order to recover stolen funds. I have clearly expressed my position : I NEVER authorized bank of america to release my deposit to a unknown theft such as XXXX XXXX ; I NEVER authorized anyone to represent me to do any banking transaction. I NEVER authorized XXXX XXXX to handle my bank account such as open new account, withdrawl funds, close accounts, obtain my personal identity, etc. In one word, I already notified law enforcement agency such as FTC, local police department, FBI, U.S. district court, State of Maryland circuit court to prosecute theft XXXX XXXX. This theft lied to the court and public : She can not handle my personal affair at all. She can only bring me damages, losses, pain, suffering, trauma, anxiety by losing my deposit. I once again ask bank of america to honor 5 cashier 's checks issued on XX/XX/XXXX due to bank 's stop payment. Cashier 's check was considering as cash and was guaranteed to pay. I am so upset that Bank of America has no any business credit at all. And can not protect consumer 's deposit. Because of this bank 's criminal activity, I lost trust toward XXXX XXXX  's practice. Please do not spread your financial crisis to me as totally irrelavent party. I have no any reason to accept such type of financial crime and deprive my rights committed by both Bank of America, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX County Circuit Court in Maryland ).</td>\n",

After a couple months of nothing, and an upcoming XXXX to XXXX we decided to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time for assistance, and they said they would n't help us so we had to leave the house as is. \\nAfter being in XXXX for a couple months a friend of mine moved into our house, and I took out a loan from my Grandfather to get caught up on the house. We than got a long term resident in the house with intentions to purchase the house from us after settling some things from his last house. We got stationed in XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX where we lived until XX/XX/XXXX. \\nIn XXXX XXXX our renter up and left the house leaving us with no notice or anything. My wife 's paycheck was going strictly towards the house for 7 months until my wife had to quit because of orders taking us to XXXX where we are currently stationed. While we tried with the bank to do a short sale, we were getting the run around which was very difficult being in XXXX, and it did n't seem like the VA was helping us get the documents loaded into the system, and I had to make daily calls for a week at a time to make sure things were getting done, and after about a month we got an offer on our house that was very good. I called Nationstar and the VA again almost on a weekly basis to try and get the house sold. After well over 90 days of waiting on the bank and making constant phone calls, there was a really bad storm in XXXX where rain had got in the basement and our sump pump went out. We were than notified that there was mold damage now, and the buyers backed out, and we do n't have the means to get the mold fixed, and the bank said they would not pay for it. \\nSo now the only thing I could think of was a Deed in Lieu, to try to get this house out of my name and try to rebuild my credit. I submitted paperwork to the bank 2 weeks ago, and since then have been contacted by the bank 4 times asking about the short sale, and how that process was going. Each time I had to explain again that I had submitted the paperwork to do a Deed in Lieu. \\nI am now convinced that if personnel that work at this bank and handled my account had done their job my house would have sold when we did the short sale, and they should be held accountable for what they have done. If this is happening to me and my family I ca n't help but think if there are other Soldiers and families going through the same difficulties as I am.

I am writing this letter to draw your attention to a few issues I have been facing with the mortgage service provided by your organization.\\n\\nHaving been a loyal customer of your bank for several years, I have always appreciated your commitment to customer satisfaction. However, my recent experiences have left me disappointed and confused. The terms associated with my mortgage loan are quite complex and lack clear explanations. While I understand that mortgage documents are typically filled with jargon, I expected a more customer-friendly approach from your team to help me understand these terms better. This lack of clarity has created a barrier to managing my loan effectively.\\n\\nAdditionally, I have noticed that the interest rates on my mortgage loan are significantly higher than the current market rates. This has made me question the fairness and transparency of your services. I have browsed other financial institutions' offerings and noticed that their rates are more competitive. This discrepancy has not only added financial strain but has also led me to question the integrity of your institution.\\n\\nI understand that interest rates may vary depending on various factors, but I was not expecting such a vast difference. I believe that customers should be treated fairly and should be made aware of any changes that directly impact them. I, unfortunately, feel blindsided by the high interest rates and the lack of communication from your side.\\n\\nIn light of these issues, I request your immediate attention in resolving my concerns. Please provide me with an easy-to-understand breakdown of my mortgage terms and lend clarity on why the interest rates applied to my loan are so high.\\n\\nI look forward to a resolution that upholds the values of transparency, fairness, and customer satisfaction. Your swift response and corrective measures will be highly appreciated.\\n\\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation.\\n\\nYours Truly,\\n\\n[Customer's Name]   \n",

I am writing to address my dissatisfaction with your Checking or Savings Account services.\\n\\nAs a long-standing patron of your bank, I have always been impressed by the quality of your financial products and services. Sadly, the events of recent months have created a sense of disillusionment and disappointment in me that I feel compelled to express.\\n\\nFirstly, I am alarmed at the number of unexpected charges that have been levied on my accounts lately. These charges, which were not explicitly outlined when I opened the account, have posed significant inconveniences as they impact my financial planning. This arbitrary application of fees is a cause of major concern for me, and I believe this to be a lapse in the commitment to transparency that your organization is known for.\\n\\nSecondly, I am saddened by the quality of customer service I've received in relation to these issues. I reached out to your customer service department on multiple occasions to seek clarity about these unfamiliar charges, only to be met with disappointing responses. The lack of promptness, empathy, and comprehensive assistance from your team has exacerbated my problems and created a sense of mistrust in my mind.\\n\\nFor these reasons, I would like to request your immediate intervention in this matter. I urge you to review the charges applied to my account and provide an in-depth explanation for each one. Additionally, I implore you to examine the handling of my case by your customer service department and take steps to ensure such shortcomings in service are not repeated.\\n\\nMy continued relationship with your bank hinges on the satisfactory resolution of these issues. I earnestly hope you will take the necessary actions to rectify these problems.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your swift and satisfactory response.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Customer's Name]   \n",

However, my experience has been marred by a series of inconsistencies and a lack of transparency that I find unacceptable.\\n\\nThe most pressing issue lies in the irregularity and inconsistency of my loan payments. Despite my diligent financial management, various discrepancies in my statements have led me to question the integrity of your process. These unexpected fluctuations have caused undue stress and confusion, making it challenging for me to maintain a predictable payment schedule.\\n\\nPerhaps more concerning is the opaque nature of your student loan system. As a customer, I feel entitled to transparency and clarity regarding my financial commitments. However, I find myself navigating through complex terminologies and inexplicable charges which are neither clear nor comprehensive. I firmly believe that a process as significant as student loan management should be transparent, with all aspects clearly explained to the concerned individual.\\n\\nGiven these circumstances, I implore you to respond swiftly and rectify the issues I face. I request an accurate breakdown of my payments, which includes a logical explanation for all unexpected charges. Additionally, I ask for a detailed clarification of my loan terms in a language that can be easily understood by someone without a financial background.\\n\\nI highly value a transparent relationship with my lender, and I am confident that you will take my concerns into consideration to ensure your commitment to customer satisfaction is fulfilled.\\n\\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to your response.\\n\\nKind regards,\\n\\n[Customer's Name]   \n",

The recurring transaction delays and unclear fees have caused me both financial and emotional distress.\\n\\nMy most urgent concern revolves around the delay in transactions. As a frequent user of your services, these delays disrupt not only my personal but also my professional deadlines. Financial transactions are time-sensitive, and such unexpected delays reflect poorly on your service's reliability and efficiency.\\n\\nIn addition, I am baffled by the unpredictable and confusing fees levied on my transactions.

I made my decision to proceed based on these given facts. Unfortunately, my subsequent financial statements revealed charges and fees that I was never briefed about nor agreed to.\\n\\nThese additional charges have proven to be a financial challenge and, I must express, quite a shock. The existence of these hidden costs has led me to seriously question the transparency and reliability of your bank's mortgage services.\\n\\nThe unexpected financial strain is further aggravated by the fact that no satisfactory explanation has been provided for these charges. I was led to believe that our agreement was clear and final. Therefore, getting billed additional sums without any forewarning or adequate clarification feels misleading and improper.\\n\\nI consider this situation a breach of trust and hope you understand the gravity of the issue at hand. I request your utmost attention to this matter. Please provide a thorough and exhaustive breakdown of my charges, including an explanation for the unexpected extra fees that have unexpectedly appeared in my statements.\\n\\nI am hopeful that this email will instigate a thorough review of my situation and lead to a fair and swift resolution. I believe it's important that all customers, including myself, receive clear information about charges and financial obligations, and I trust you will take immediate steps to remedy the current situation.\\n\\nLooking forward to your prompt response.\\n\\nYours Faithfully,\\n\\n[Customer's Name]   \n",

However, my experience so far has been quite contrary to my initial expectations, leaving me disappointed and financially stressed.\\n\\nThe crux of my issue lies in the unexpected increases in the interest rate of my student loan. These sudden hikes, that too without any prior information, are not only startling but also severely disrupt my financial planning. I am under the impression that this practice is unfair and lacks transparency, which contradicts the values your institution is reputed to uphold.\\n\\nMoreover, the response from your customer support to resolve these issues has been disheartening.

I am writing to you as a deeply dissatisfied customer of your bank, particularly the Checking or Savings account service. I have found myself repeatedly frustrated and disappointed with the service I have received, and I feel it is necessary to alert you to these issues.\\n\\nMy first grievance pertains to unexpected fees that have been levied on my account. I have been charged numerous times for services I do not recall ever agreeing to, and I find these fees both confusing and detrimental to my financial well-being. The lack of communication and consultation regarding these charges undermines your bank's supposed commitment to transparency and customer satisfaction.\\n\\nMy second issue lies with the customer service I have received when seeking resolution for these unexpected fees. My enquiries have either been met with slow responses, or worse, none at all. When I have received responses, they have lacked both empathy and efficiency. This is not the level of service I expect from a bank of your reputation.\\n\\nIn addition to these issues, I have observed a lack of preventive measures or solutions offered to avoid similar issues in the future. This indicates a lack of efficiency and customer care, traits that are essential in modern banking.\\n\\nI am writing to request that my concerns be addressed as soon as possible. I would like a full explanation of these unexpected fees, a refund for any charges that were not explicitly agreed upon, and an assurance that these issues will not reoccur. Also, I would like to see a significant improvement in the quality of customer service.\\n\\nA prompt and fair resolution to this matter would go a long way in restoring my faith in your services.

One of my initial attractions to your services was the affordable interest rates offered, which, regrettably, have seen a significant and unanticipated increase recently. This has put strain on my financial planning and has caused undue stress.\\n\\nIn addition, I am dismayed at the lack of communication about these rate changes. It was only after I noticed the change in my monthly repayments that I was informed about this rate increase. The sudden and unexpected change, coupled with the lack of communication, is disturbing and leads to a sense of distrust.\\n\\nCustomers put great faith in their mortgage providers, and any changes in the agreed-upon terms should be transparently communicated in a timely manner. This abrupt change has affected my monthly budget, and had I been informed in advance, I would have had the opportunity to make necessary adjustments to accommodate this change.\\n\\nTherefore, I kindly request an immediate, thorough investigation into this matter. I would appreciate a comprehensive explanation for the reason behind this rate hike and why this crucial information was not communicated to me beforehand.\\n\\nThe foundation of our professional relationship is trust and open communication, and I hope you will address my concerns and restore my faith in your services.\\n\\nThank you for your attention and I am hopeful for a prompt resolution.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\n[Customer Name]   \n",

However, my recent experiences have left me disappointed and confused. The terms associated with my mortgage loan are quite complex and lack clear explanations. While I understand that mortgage documents are typically filled with jargon, I expected a more customer-friendly approach from your team to help me understand these terms better. This lack of clarity has created a barrier to managing my loan effectively.\\n\\nAdditionally, I have noticed that the interest rates on my mortgage loan are significantly higher than the current market rates. This has made me question the fairness and transparency of your services. I have browsed other financial institutions' offerings and noticed that their rates are more competitive. This discrepancy has not only added financial strain but has also led me to question the integrity of your institution.\\n\\nI understand that interest rates may vary depending on various factors, but I was not expecting such a vast difference. I believe that customers should be treated fairly and should be made aware of any changes that directly impact them. I, unfortunately, feel blindsided by the high interest rates and the lack of communication from your side.\\n\\nIn light of these issues, I request your immediate attention in resolving my concerns. Please provide me with an easy-to-understand breakdown of my mortgage terms and lend clarity on why the interest rates applied to my loan are so high.\\n\\nI look forward to a resolution that upholds the values of transparency, fairness, and customer satisfaction.

Recently, I've been charged with numerous fees that were never disclosed to me at the time of the creation of my account. It is disconcerting to see unexpected deductions from my balance without any prior information. Not only has this led to significant financial inconvenience, but it has also made me question the transparency of your services.\\n\\nMoreover, I have called your customer service helpline several times to comprehend these charges. Instead of receiving prompt and adequate support, I was met with unresponsiveness and vague answers. The absence of efficient customer service has further exacerbated my concerns and left me feeling neglected by an institution I have trusted with my financial wellbeing.\\n\\nIn view of the above, I demand an immediate and thorough examination of these hidden charges on my account. I request a detailed breakdown of all the fees and charges applied to my account along with an explanation for each one. Further, I urge you to assess your customer service operations and take necessary rectifications to ensure customers are met with the support they require.\\n\\nThe trust and loyalty of your customers are built on the foundation of transparency and excellent customer service.

I am writing this letter to draw your attention to a few issues I have been facing with the mortgage service provided by your organization.\\n\\nHaving been a loyal customer of your bank for several years, I have always appreciated your commitment to customer satisfaction. However, my recent experiences have left me disappointed and confused. The terms associated with my mortgage loan are quite complex and lack clear explanations. While I understand that mortgage documents are typically filled with jargon, I expected a more customer-friendly approach from your team to help me understand these terms better. This lack of clarity has created a barrier to managing my loan effectively.\\n\\nAdditionally, I have noticed that the interest rates on my mortgage loan are significantly higher than the current market rates. This has made me question the fairness and transparency of your services. I have browsed other financial institutions' offerings and noticed that their rates are more competitive. This discrepancy has not only added financial strain but has also led me to question the integrity of your institution.\\n\\nI understand that interest rates may vary depending on various factors, but I was not expecting such a vast difference. I believe that customers should be treated fairly and should be made aware of any changes that directly impact them. I, unfortunately, feel blindsided by the high interest rates and the lack of communication from your side.\\n\\nIn light of these issues, I request your immediate attention in resolving my concerns. Please provide me with an easy-to-understand breakdown of my mortgage terms and lend clarity on why the interest rates applied to my loan are so high.\\n\\nI look forward to a resolution that upholds the values of transparency, fairness, and customer satisfaction. Your swift response and corrective measures will be highly appreciated.\\n\\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation.\\n\\nYours Truly,\\n\\n[Customer's Name]\n",

I am writing to address my dissatisfaction with your Checking or Savings Account services.\\n\\nAs a long-standing patron of your bank, I have always been impressed by the quality of your financial products and services. Sadly, the events of recent months have created a sense of disillusionment and disappointment in me that I feel compelled to express.\\n\\nFirstly, I am alarmed at the number of unexpected charges that have been levied on my accounts lately. These charges, which were not explicitly outlined when I opened the account, have posed significant inconveniences as they impact my financial planning. This arbitrary application of fees is a cause of major concern for me, and I believe this to be a lapse in the commitment to transparency that your organization is known for.\\n\\nSecondly, I am saddened by the quality of customer service I've received in relation to these issues. I reached out to your customer service department on multiple occasions to seek clarity about these unfamiliar charges, only to be met with disappointing responses. The lack of promptness, empathy, and comprehensive assistance from your team has exacerbated my problems and created a sense of mistrust in my mind.\\n\\nFor these reasons, I would like to request your immediate intervention in this matter. I urge you to review the charges applied to my account and provide an in-depth explanation for each one. Additionally, I implore you to examine the handling of my case by your customer service department and take steps to ensure such shortcomings in service are not repeated.\\n\\nMy continued relationship with your bank hinges on the satisfactory resolution of these issues. I earnestly hope you will take the necessary actions to rectify these problems.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your swift and satisfactory response.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Customer's Name]\n",

However, my experience has been marred by a series of inconsistencies and a lack of transparency that I find unacceptable.\\n\\nThe most pressing issue lies in the irregularity and inconsistency of my loan payments. Despite my diligent financial management, various discrepancies in my statements have led me to question the integrity of your process. These unexpected fluctuations have caused undue stress and confusion, making it challenging for me to maintain a predictable payment schedule.\\n\\nPerhaps more concerning is the opaque nature of your student loan system. As a customer, I feel entitled to transparency and clarity regarding my financial commitments. However, I find myself navigating through complex terminologies and inexplicable charges which are neither clear nor comprehensive. I firmly believe that a process as significant as student loan management should be transparent, with all aspects clearly explained to the concerned individual.\\n\\nGiven these circumstances, I implore you to respond swiftly and rectify the issues I face. I request an accurate breakdown of my payments, which includes a logical explanation for all unexpected charges. Additionally, I ask for a detailed clarification of my loan terms in a language that can be easily understood by someone without a financial background.\\n\\nI highly value a transparent relationship with my lender, and I am confident that you will take my concerns into consideration to ensure your commitment to customer satisfaction is fulfilled.\\n\\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to your response.\\n\\nKind regards,\\n\\n[Customer's Name]\n",

The recurring transaction delays and unclear fees have caused me both financial and emotional distress.\\n\\nMy most urgent concern revolves around the delay in transactions. As a frequent user of your services, these delays disrupt not only my personal but also my professional deadlines. Financial transactions are time-sensitive, and such unexpected delays reflect poorly on your service's reliability and efficiency.\\n\\nIn addition, I am baffled by the unpredictable and confusing fees levied on my transactions. The additional charges, which do not align with the fee structure shared at the onset, have left me perplexed. This lack of transparency is unsettling and raises questions about your institution's integrity.\\n\\nGiven the gravity of these concerns, I urge you to investigate and provide a detailed explanation regarding the transaction delays and fee discrepancies.

The existence of these hidden costs has led me to seriously question the transparency and reliability of your bank's mortgage services.\\n\\nThe unexpected financial strain is further aggravated by the fact that no satisfactory explanation has been provided for these charges. I was led to believe that our agreement was clear and final. Therefore, getting billed additional sums without any forewarning or adequate clarification feels misleading and improper.\\n\\nI consider this situation a breach of trust and hope you understand the gravity of the issue at hand. I request your utmost attention to this matter. Please provide a thorough and exhaustive breakdown of my charges, including an explanation for the unexpected extra fees that have unexpectedly appeared in my statements.\\n\\nI am hopeful that this email will instigate a thorough review of my situation and lead to a fair and swift resolution. I believe it's important that all customers, including myself, receive clear information about charges and financial obligations, and I trust you will take immediate steps to remedy the current situation.\\n\\nLooking forward to your prompt response.\\n\\nYours Faithfully,\\n\\n[Customer's Name]\n",

However, my experience so far has been quite contrary to my initial expectations, leaving me disappointed and financially stressed.\\n\\nThe crux of my issue lies in the unexpected increases in the interest rate of my student loan. These sudden hikes, that too without any prior information, are not only startling but also severely disrupt my financial planning. I am under the impression that this practice is unfair and lacks transparency, which contradicts the values your institution is reputed to uphold.\\n\\nMoreover, the response from your customer support to resolve these issues has been disheartening. I have found it difficult to get through to a representative and when I do, the responses are vague and devoid of any concrete solutions. Instead of alleviating my concerns, these interactions have only enhanced my frustration.\\n\\nI strongly urge you to look into this matter and provide an explanation for the sudden and repeated increases in my loan's interest rate.

I am writing to you as a deeply dissatisfied customer of your bank, particularly the Checking or Savings account service. I have found myself repeatedly frustrated and disappointed with the service I have received, and I feel it is necessary to alert you to these issues.\\n\\nMy first grievance pertains to unexpected fees that have been levied on my account. I have been charged numerous times for services I do not recall ever agreeing to, and I find these fees both confusing and detrimental to my financial well-being. The lack of communication and consultation regarding these charges undermines your bank's supposed commitment to transparency and customer satisfaction.\\n\\nMy second issue lies with the customer service I have received when seeking resolution for these unexpected fees. My enquiries have either been met with slow responses, or worse, none at all. When I have received responses, they have lacked both empathy and efficiency. This is not the level of service I expect from a bank of your reputation.\\n\\nIn addition to these issues, I have observed a lack of preventive measures or solutions offered to avoid similar issues in the future. This indicates a lack of efficiency and customer care, traits that are essential in modern banking.\\n\\nI am writing to request that my concerns be addressed as soon as possible. I would like a full explanation of these unexpected fees, a refund for any charges that were not explicitly agreed upon, and an assurance that these issues will not reoccur.

One of my initial attractions to your services was the affordable interest rates offered, which, regrettably, have seen a significant and unanticipated increase recently. This has put strain on my financial planning and has caused undue stress.\\n\\nIn addition, I am dismayed at the lack of communication about these rate changes. It was only after I noticed the change in my monthly repayments that I was informed about this rate increase. The sudden and unexpected change, coupled with the lack of communication, is disturbing and leads to a sense of distrust.\\n\\nCustomers put great faith in their mortgage providers, and any changes in the agreed-upon terms should be transparently communicated in a timely manner. This abrupt change has affected my monthly budget, and had I been informed in advance, I would have had the opportunity to make necessary adjustments to accommodate this change.\\n\\nTherefore, I kindly request an immediate, thorough investigation into this matter. I would appreciate a comprehensive explanation for the reason behind this rate hike and why this crucial information was not communicated to me beforehand.\\n\\nThe foundation of our professional relationship is trust and open communication, and I hope you will address my concerns and restore my faith in your services.\\n\\nThank you for your attention and I am hopeful for a prompt resolution.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\n[Customer Name]"

However, my recent experiences have left me disappointed and confused. The terms associated with my mortgage loan are quite complex and lack clear explanations. While I understand that mortgage documents are typically filled with jargon, I expected a more customer-friendly approach from your team to help me understand these terms better. This lack of clarity has created a barrier to managing my loan effectively.\\n\\nAdditionally, I have noticed that the interest rates on my mortgage loan are significantly higher than the current market rates. This has made me question the fairness and transparency of your services. I have browsed other financial institutions' offerings and noticed that their rates are more competitive. This discrepancy has not only added financial strain but has also led me to question the integrity of your institution.\\n\\nI understand that interest rates may vary depending on various factors, but I was not expecting such a vast difference. I believe that customers should be treated fairly and should be made aware of any changes that directly impact them. I, unfortunately, feel blindsided by the high interest rates and the lack of communication from your side.\\n\\nIn light of these issues, I request your immediate attention in resolving my concerns. Please provide me with an easy-to-understand breakdown of my mortgage terms and lend clarity on why the interest rates applied to my loan are so high.\\n\\nI look forward to a resolution that upholds the values of transparency, fairness, and customer satisfaction.

I reached out to your customer service department on multiple occasions to seek clarity about these unfamiliar charges, only to be met with disappointing responses.

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the Checking or savings account service provided by your bank.\\n\\nMy trust in your institution is built on the premise of transparency, honesty, and customer satisfaction. However, my recent experiences have made me question these values. I am quite disturbed by the unexpected charges that have been deducted from my account. This lack of transparency and the subsequent financial loss has left me disappointed and frustrated.\\n\\nAdditionally, the interest rates on my savings account are considerably lower than I was initially offered. This has resulted in a significant reduction in my expected savings growth. When choosing your bank for my savings account, an important consideration was the promise of competitive interest rates. My current experiences, however, do not align with this promise, leaving me to question the credibility of your services.\\n\\nMy attempts to seek clarity and resolution on these issues through your customer service have been futile. The unresponsiveness and lack of empathy from the customer service representatives are not in line with the high standard of service I expected from your esteemed institution.\\n\\nI hereby request immediate attention to rectify these issues. I urge you to provide a thorough explanation of the charges on my account, and a clear rationale for the lower-than-promised interest rates on my savings. I also expect a considerable improvement in your customer service.\\n\\nI believe in your institution's ability to rectify this situation promptly. Your immediate action will not only resolve the current issues but also help rebuild my confidence in your services.\\n\\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to resolving these issues.\\n\\nBest Regards,\\n\\n[Customer's Name]</td>\n",

I made my decision to proceed based on these given facts. Unfortunately, my subsequent financial statements revealed charges and fees that I was never briefed about nor agreed to.\\n\\nThese additional charges have proven to be a financial challenge and, I must express, quite a shock. The existence of these hidden costs has led me to seriously question the transparency and reliability of your bank's mortgage services.\\n\\nThe unexpected financial strain is further aggravated by the fact that no satisfactory explanation has been provided for these charges. I was led to believe that our agreement was clear and final. Therefore, getting billed additional sums without any forewarning or adequate clarification feels misleading and improper.\\n\\nI consider this situation a breach of trust and hope you understand the gravity of the issue at hand. I request your utmost attention to this matter. Please provide a thorough and exhaustive breakdown of my charges, including an explanation for the unexpected extra fees that have unexpectedly appeared in my statements.\\n\\nI am hopeful that this email will instigate a thorough review of my situation and lead to a fair and swift resolution. I believe it's important that all customers, including myself, receive clear information about charges and financial obligations, and I trust you will take immediate steps to remedy the current situation.\\n\\nLooking forward to your prompt response.\\n\\nYours Faithfully,\\n\\n[Customer's Name]</td>\n",

However, I am taken aback to find that the interest rates have surged extraordinarily without any prior notification or explanation. This unexpected hike has caused a significant financial burden on me, and it appears the terms of the loan have been altered unilaterally, which is distinctly unfair.\\n\\nIn an attempt to gain clarification over this situation, I tried reaching out to your customer service multiple times, only to be met with non-cooperation. The lack of communication and unresponsiveness to my queries made me question the effectiveness of your customer service team.\\n\\nTherefore, I am writing to request an immediate investigation into this matter. I would appreciate a detailed statement explaining the sudden increase in the interest rates. I also urge you to conduct a review of your customer service operations to ensure that such issues are handled more efficiently in the future.\\n\\nIt is essential that financial institutions like yours operate with complete transparency, maintaining clear and open communication with customers. This fosters trust and confidence in your services.

However, I've observed a significant increase in my interest rate, which was not previously communicated or agreed upon.\\n\\nThe escalated interest charges have resulted in a severe financial burden. This unexpected and sharp increase has instilled doubts about the transparency and integrity of your services. It's distressing to contemplate that an institution that ought to support students' ambitions is instead causing financial stress.\\n\\nAdding to this is the lackluster customer service I've encountered. Repeated attempts to gain clarity and resolution through customer service have been futile. The representatives seem ill-equipped to handle my grievances, and no substantial assistance or clarification has been provided thus far.\\n\\nI am writing this letter to voice my frustration and to request immediate action. I demand a clear statement detailing the interest rate structure of my loan, along with an explanation of the sudden increase. Furthermore, I suggest a revamp of your customer service training to ensure representatives are adequately equipped to handle and resolve customer issues.\\n\\nBy addressing these issues promptly, you can restore my confidence and trust in your services, both of which are currently faltering.

However, my experience so far has been quite contrary to my initial expectations, leaving me disappointed and financially stressed.\\n\\nThe crux of my issue lies in the unexpected increases in the interest rate of my student loan. These sudden hikes, that too without any prior information, are not only startling but also severely disrupt my financial planning. I am under the impression that this practice is unfair and lacks transparency, which contradicts the values your institution is reputed to uphold.\\n\\nMoreover, the response from your customer support to resolve these issues has been disheartening. I have found it difficult to get through to a representative and when I do, the responses are vague and devoid of any concrete solutions. Instead of alleviating my concerns, these interactions have only enhanced my frustration.\\n\\nI strongly urge you to look into this matter and provide an explanation for the sudden and repeated increases in my loan's interest rate. Furthermore, I request a more efficient and customer-friendly approach from your support team. As a customer, these improvements will go a long way in restoring my faith in your services.\\n\\nThank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

I am writing to you as a deeply dissatisfied customer of your bank, particularly the Checking or Savings account service. I have found myself repeatedly frustrated and disappointed with the service I have received, and I feel it is necessary to alert you to these issues.\\n\\nMy first grievance pertains to unexpected fees that have been levied on my account. I have been charged numerous times for services I do not recall ever agreeing to, and I find these fees both confusing and detrimental to my financial well-being. The lack of communication and consultation regarding these charges undermines your bank's supposed commitment to transparency and customer satisfaction.\\n\\nMy second issue lies with the customer service I have received when seeking resolution for these unexpected fees. My enquiries have either been met with slow responses, or worse, none at all. When I have received responses, they have lacked both empathy and efficiency. This is not the level of service I expect from a bank of your reputation.\\n\\nIn addition to these issues, I have observed a lack of preventive measures or solutions offered to avoid similar issues in the future. This indicates a lack of efficiency and customer care, traits that are essential in modern banking.\\n\\nI am writing to request that my concerns be addressed as soon as possible. I would like a full explanation of these unexpected fees, a refund for any charges that were not explicitly agreed upon, and an assurance that these issues will not reoccur. Also, I would like to see a significant improvement in the quality of customer service.\\n\\nA prompt and fair resolution to this matter would go a long way in restoring my faith in your services.

One of my initial attractions to your services was the affordable interest rates offered, which, regrettably, have seen a significant and unanticipated increase recently. This has put strain on my financial planning and has caused undue stress.\\n\\nIn addition, I am dismayed at the lack of communication about these rate changes. It was only after I noticed the change in my monthly repayments that I was informed about this rate increase. The sudden and unexpected change, coupled with the lack of communication, is disturbing and leads to a sense of distrust.\\n\\nCustomers put great faith in their mortgage providers, and any changes in the agreed-upon terms should be transparently communicated in a timely manner. This abrupt change has affected my monthly budget, and had I been informed in advance, I would have had the opportunity to make necessary adjustments to accommodate this change.\\n\\nTherefore, I kindly request an immediate, thorough investigation into this matter. I would appreciate a comprehensive explanation for the reason behind this rate hike and why this crucial information was not communicated to me beforehand.\\n\\nThe foundation of our professional relationship is trust and open communication, and I hope you will address my concerns and restore my faith in your services.\\n\\nThank you for your attention and I am hopeful for a prompt resolution.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\n[Customer Name]</td>\n",

One of my initial attractions to your services was the affordable interest rates offered, which, regrettably, have seen a significant and unanticipated increase recently. This has put strain on my financial planning and has caused undue stress.\\n\\nIn addition, I am dismayed at the lack of communication about these rate changes. It was only after I noticed the change in my monthly repayments that I was informed about this rate increase. The sudden and unexpected change, coupled with the lack of communication, is disturbing and leads to a sense of distrust.\\n\\nCustomers put great faith in their mortgage providers, and any changes in the agreed-upon terms should be transparently communicated in a timely manner. This abrupt change has affected my monthly budget, and had I been informed in advance, I would have had the opportunity to make necessary adjustments to accommodate this change.\\n\\nTherefore, I kindly request an immediate, thorough investigation into this matter. I would appreciate a comprehensive explanation for the reason behind this rate hike and why this crucial information was not communicated to me beforehand.\\n\\nThe foundation of our professional relationship is trust and open communication, and I hope you will address my concerns and restore my faith in your services.\\n\\nThank you for your attention and I am hopeful for a prompt resolution.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\n[Customer Name]'},\n",
